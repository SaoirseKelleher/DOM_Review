However, species-specific dispersal heterogeneities are not well integrated into our general understanding of how spatial coexistence emerges between competitors. Combining both network and metapopulation approaches, we construct a spatially explicit, patch-occupancy dynamic model for communities with hierarchically preemptive competition, to explore species coexistence in shared vs. non-shared dispersal networks with contrasting heterogeneities (including regular, random, exponential and scale-free networks). Our model shows that species with the same demography (i.e. identical colonization and extinction rates) cannot coexist stably in shared networks (i.e. the same dispersal pathways), regardless of dispersal heterogeneity. In contrast, increasing dispersal heterogeneity (even at very low levels of heterogeneity) in non-shared networks can greatly promote spatial coexistence, owing to the segregation-aggregation mechanism by which each species is restricted to self-organized clusters with a core of the most connected patches. However, these competitive patterns are largely mediated by species life-history attributes, for example, a unimodal biodiversity response to an increase of species dispersal rate emerges in non-shared heterogeneous networks, with species richness peaking at intermediate dispersal levels. Interestingly, increasing network size can foster species coexistence, leading to a monotonic increase in species-area curves. This strongly suggests that, unexpectedly, many more species can co-occur than the number of limiting resources. Overall, this modelling study, filling the gap between network structure and spatial competition, provides new insights into the coexistence mechanisms of spatial heterogeneity.","2019-12-15","2021-10-27 00:03:50","2021-10-27 00:03:50","2021-10-27 00:03:50","","","","","","","","","","","","Ecology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2019.12.14.876383","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/CWBLS99L/Zhang and Liao - 2019 - Non-shared dispersal networks with heterogeneity p.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used an integrated habitat–occupancy model to simultaneously quantify habitat change, site ﬁdelity, and local colonization and extinction rates for larvae of a suite of Great Plains stream ﬁshes in the Arikaree River, eastern Colorado, USA, across three years. Sites were located along a gradient of ﬂow intermittency and groundwater connectivity. Hydrology varied across years: the ﬁrst and third being relatively wet and the second dry. Despite hydrologic variation, our results indicated that site suitability was random from one year to the next. Occupancy probabilities were also independent of previous habitat and occupancy state for most species, indicating little site ﬁdelity. Climate and groundwater connectivity were important drivers of local extinction and colonization, but the importance of groundwater differed between periods. Across species, site extinction probabilities were highest during the transition from wet to dry conditions (range: 0.52–0.98), and the effect of groundwater was apparent with higher extinction probabilities for sites not fed by groundwater. Colonization probabilities during this period were relatively low for both previously dry sites (range: 0.02–0.38) and previously wet sites (range: 0.02–0.43). In contrast, no sites dried or remained dry during the transition from dry to wet conditions, yielding lower but still substantial extinction probabilities (range: 0.16–0.63) and higher colonization probabilities (range: 0.06–0.86), with little difference among sites with and without groundwater. This approach of jointly modeling both habitat change and species occupancy will likely be useful to incorporate effects of dynamic habitat on metapopulation processes and to better inform appropriate conservation actions.","2012-04","2021-10-27 00:03:53","2021-10-27 00:03:53","2021-10-27 00:03:53","858-867","","4","93","","Ecology","Colonization and extinction in dynamic habitats","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/5MYYYAHN/Falke et al. - 2012 - Colonization and extinction in dynamic habitats a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We formally tested two of the principal biological mechanisms already proposed (i.e. the niche breadth hypothesis and the resource availability hypothesis). We found no support for the niche breadth hypothesis. In contrast, we found consistent support for the closely related resource availability hypothesis. Species utilising resources (habitats) that are marginal tend to appear at low density and to have narrow distribution whereas species utilising widespread habitats tend to be more abundant and more widely distributed. Using data on body size and reproductive traits we explored the potential influence of these variables in explaining significant variation around the density-range size relationship.

We developed a spatially based simulation program that accounts for natural history, habitat use, and sampling scheme to investigate the power of monitoring protocols to detect trends in population abundance over time with occupancy-based methods. We analyzed monitoring schemes with different sampling efforts for wolverine (Gulo gulo) populations in 2 areas of the U.S. Rocky Mountains. The relation between occupancy and abundance was nonlinear and depended on landscape, population size, and movement parameters. With current estimates for population size and detection probability in the northern U.S. Rockies, most sampling schemes were only able to detect large declines in abundance in the simulations (i.e., 50% decline over 10 years). For small populations reestablishing in the Southern Rockies, occupancy-based methods had enough power to detect population trends only when populations were increasing dramatically (e.g., doubling or tripling in 10 years), regardless of sampling effort. In general, increasing the number of cells sampled or the per-visit detection probability had a much greater effect on power than the number of visits conducted during a survey. Although our results are specific to wolverines, this approach could easily be adapted to other territorial species.","2014-02","2021-10-27 00:07:10","2021-10-27 00:07:10","2021-10-27 00:07:10","52-62","","1","28","","Conservation Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/4CB4YUPP/Ellis et al. - 2014 - Spatially Explicit Power Analyses for Occupancy‐Ba.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In subtropical regions, Ae. aegypti often presents an annual abundance cycle driven by weather conditions. Because different population states may show varying responses to control, we are interested in studying what time of the year is most appropriate for control. To do so, we developed two dynamic site-occupancy models based on more than 200 weeks of mosquito trapping data from nearly 900 sites in a subtropical Brazilian city. Our phenomenological, Markovian models, ﬁtted to data in a Bayesian framework, accounted for failure to detect mosquitoes in two alternative ways and for temporal variation in dynamic rates of local extinction and colonization of new sites. Infestation varied from nearly full cover of the city area in late summer, to between 10% and 67% of sites occupied in winter depending on the model. Sensitivity analysis reveals that changes in dynamic rates should have the greatest impact on site occupancy during autumn and early winter months, when the mosquito population is declining. We discuss the implications of this ﬁnding to the timing of mosquito control.","2020-07-08","2021-10-27 00:07:15","2021-10-27 00:07:15","2021-10-27 00:07:15","445-454","","1","103","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/CRZZYV3Q/Mores et al. - 2020 - Site Occupancy by Aedes aegypti in a Subtropical C.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted occupancy surveys for an umbrella species, the Coastal California Gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica), from 2004 to 2009 in San Diego County, California, focusing on preserve lands associated with HCPs. We investigated the effects of habitat quality classification, elevation, distance to coast, and heat load on gnatcatcher occupancy, extinction, and colonization probabilities. Our work focused on these factors throughout the range of this species in San Diego County where, through conservation agreements, a preserve system has been assembled addressing management considerations at a landscape scale. In addition, a large wildfire in 2003 burned 17,044 ha, roughly 1/3 of preserve lands, thus we were able to investigate the recolonization process associated with this event. We found that occupancy increased with habitat quality and over time, but decreased with elevation. Extinction probability was generally constant (~0.13), but colonization varied greatly, with probabilities being greater in higher quality habitat and at lower elevations. Gnatcatchers were more likely to colonize burned areas adjacent to high and very high quality habitat, sites that should receive priority conservation actions, particularly at lower elevations. Our work suggests that umbrella species, like the California Gnatcatcher, may reflect not just habitat quality, but may also be useful indicators of recovery after an unexpected event such as fire. Although not perfect, the use of multiple umbrella species in HCPs may lead to effective conservation and management of biodiversity hotspots.","2014-11","2021-10-27 00:07:18","2021-10-27 00:07:18","2021-10-27 00:07:18","538-545","","4","116","","The Condor","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/XU4KY5JJ/Winchell and Doherty - 2014 - Effects of habitat quality and wildfire on occupan.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identifying how populations are aﬀected by landscape barriers such as roads is essential for conservation and requires understanding the processes underpinning species occupancy in fragmented landscapes. Here, I assessed relationships between the occupancy dynamics of the threatened green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) and accessible habitat; i.e., the area of breeding and non-breeding habitat around a wetland that can be reached by an amphibian without having to cross a highway. I hypothesised that relationships between occupancy and accessible habitat would be stronger than relationships with the area of extant native vegetation, road density or distance to the highway. I also examined relationships with local habitat variables over a three-year period. Relationships with accessible habitat were stronger and more certain in explaining L. aurea occupancy and colonisation than other landscape variables. Accessible habitat was positively associated with wetland occupancy, which suggests the highway is having a barrier eﬀect on the population. There was a positive relationship between road density and the probability of local extinction. Occupancy rates at highway compensatory ponds increased from near-zero within six months of pond construction, to > 30% after 12 months. There was a negative relationship between local extinction and aquatic vegetation cover, highlighting the importance of habitat structure for L. aurea.

With virtually no history of timber harvest or large forest disturbance within MRNP boundaries since the park’s creation in 1899, MRNP provides an ideal place to evaluate potential impacts of climate change and invasive Barred Owls (Strix varia) on the Northern Spotted Owl. We used a multi-state, multi-season occupancy model to investigate how Northern Spotted Owl occupancy dynamics and breeding propensity are related to the presence of Barred Owls, local and regional weather, and habitat characteristics at MRNP from 1997 to 2016. Historical occupancy of Northern Spotted Owl breeding territories in MRNP has declined by 50% in the last 20 yr, and territory occupancy by breeding Northern Spotted Owls also decreased, reaching a low of 25% in 2016. Occupancy rates were higher on territories with steeper terrain and breeding rates were lower when Barred Owls were detected within historical territories. Our results also indicated that breeding propensity was higher when early nesting season temperatures during March and April were higher. In addition, the ability to detect breeding Northern Spotted Owls decreased when Barred Owls were present in the territory. Habitat variables from LiDAR were not correlated with Northern Spotted Owl occupancy dynamics, likely reflecting the dominance of old-growth forest in this protected park.

This study reports on its impact on forest canopy openness at six lowland rain forest sites with contrasting management histories (old-growth, selectively logged and regrowth). Percentage canopy openness was calculated from individual hemispherical photographs taken from marked points below the forest canopy at nine plots per site 3–4 mo before the cyclone, and at the same points a month afterwards. Before the cyclone, when nine sites were visited, canopy openness in old-growth and logged sites was similar, but signiﬁcantly higher in regrowth forest. After the cyclone, all six revisited sites showed an increase in canopy openness, but the increase was very patchy amongst plots and sites and varied from insigniﬁcant to severe. The most severely impacted site was an old-growth one, the least impacted a logged one. Although proneness to impact was apparently related to forest management history (old-growth being the most impacted), underlying local topography may have had an equally strong inﬂuence in this case. It was concluded that the likelihood of severe impact may be determined at the landscape-scale by the interaction of anthropogenic with meteorological, physiographic and biotic factors.

However, despite the clear spatial nature of the data used for such investigations, the spatial distribution of the different sampled locations is rarely explicitly considered, which may be critical for statistical and biological reasons. In a recent study, Chown et al. (1998) investigated the relationships between species richness of different indigenous and introduced taxonomic groups and a variety of variables characterizing Southern Ocean islands, and here, we use these data to address spatial issues. As predicted, we found spatial autocorrelation in species richness for terrestrial taxa with high dispersal ability or for terrestrial taxa that had time to disperse locally (introduced land birds and indigenous taxa) but not for taxa that had low opportunity to disperse to nearby islands (introduced plants, insects, and mammals), which suggests that colonization from nearby islands has played an important role in shaping present-day patterns of among-island variation in species richness. Interestingly, in several cases, the estimated effect of variables changed when spatial covariance was incorporated. Moreover, the absence of autocorrelation of some variables allowed us to conﬁrm some important results of Chown et al.

Our case study concerns the management of human recreational activities at Alaska’s Denali National Park, USA, and the possible impacts of such activities on nesting Golden Eagles, Aquila chrysaetos. Managers desire to allow visitors the greatest amount of access to park lands, provided that eagle nesting-site occupancy is maintained at a level determined to be acceptable by the managers themselves. As these two management objectives are potentially at odds, we treat minimum desired occupancy level as a utility threshold which, then, serves to guide the selection of annual management alternatives in the decision process.","2014","2021-10-27 00:17:14","2021-10-27 00:17:14","2021-10-27 00:17:14","67-86","","","","","","Application of Threshold Concepts to Ecological Management Problems","","","","","Springer New York","New York, NY","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4899-8041-0_5","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/BSTHGVB6/Eaton et al. - 2014 - Application of Threshold Concepts to Ecological Ma.pdf","","","","Guntenspergen, Glenn R.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ecologists have attempted to distinguish between these two sets of processes using graphical evidence for local assemblage saturation. However, such efforts have been controversial and are antithetical to the fact that local diversity bears an imprint of both. We examine the local–regional species richness relationship from the perspective of the theory of island biogeography and develop a model that can produce the full range of observed local–regional richness relationships from linear to curvilinear. Importantly, unlike previous models, we do not require species interactions to produce the curvilinear pattern. Curvilinear relationships arise if per-species stochastic extinction rates are substantially higher than colonization rates, while linear relationships result if colonization rates are higher than extinction rates. Because we also show that merely changing the sampling scale can make local–regional relationships appear either saturated or unsaturated, an inference of ecological processes, derived solely from local–regional relationships, is unwarranted.","2005-02","2021-10-27 00:17:17","2021-10-27 00:17:17","2021-10-27 00:17:17","360-365","","2","86","","Ecology","THE LOCAL–REGIONAL RELATIONSHIP","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/AJHLZIST/He et al. - 2005 - THE LOCAL–REGIONAL RELATIONSHIP IMMIGRATION, EXTI.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We develop a model that draws on elements of metapopulation models of competitors and food chains by allowing competitors to coexist locally in the presence of predators but not in their absence. The model predicts that predators promote regional coexistence by greatly expanding the range of conditions under which two competitors persist at equilibrium. Predators could have positive or negative effects on mean local diversity within the region depending on their dispersal rates, those of the prey, and their effects on prey extinction rates. The presence of predators increased the abundance of inferior competitors, thereby expanding the conditions for positive relationships between local and regional diversity. The model also predicted positive correlations between local diversity of predators and prey. These predictions were supported by patterns of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and ﬁsh species richness among lakes. The model may help to resolve the apparent contrast between linear patterns of local and regional richness and experimental evidence for strong invasion resistance and rapid dispersal in zooplankton.","2001-12","2021-10-27 00:17:20","2021-10-27 00:17:20","2021-10-27 00:17:20","624-637","","6","158","","The American Naturalist","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/8U9KD2HG/Shurin and Allen - 2001 - Effects of Competition, Predation, and Dispersal o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contemporary dynamic co-o­ ccurrence models often focus on simple presence/absence despite evidence that the influence of interactions may extend beyond species presence to behaviors influencing fitness such as mating success or recruitment. Here, we propose a joint model of species interaction dynamics that extends to multistate processes for each species, while limiting the attendant combinatorial expansion in the number of parameters. In our model, one or more states of a subordinate species are assumed to depend on the state of a dominant species, but a reciprocal dependency does not exist. This model results in a more concise representation of dominant-s­ ubordinate species interactions compared with other approaches, which should aid in model setup, fitting, and interpretation. The basic framework we outline can be fit in either Bayesian or maximum-l­ikelihood modes of inference, can include interaction lag effects, and deals efficiently with cases where data are missing for one species but not the other. We evaluate interactions between the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) and barred owl (Strix varia)—the latter species is considered to be dominant—using long-t­erm empirical data collected in Oregon, USA. Our results suggest state-s­ pecific interactions between the two species where barred owls are associated with declines in spotted owl pairings, but not necessarily occupancy.","2016-10","2021-10-27 00:20:02","2021-10-27 00:20:02","2021-10-27 00:20:02","","","10","7","","Ecosphere","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/LDI5UE4V/Jones and Kroll - 2016 - A joint model of species interaction dynamics for .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Location: Dune slacks at the Belgian and North French coast. Method: Frequency distribution patterns of species were tested over different scale levels (ranging from 0.008 to 45 km2). Analyses were executed for the total species pool and for subsets of species with high and low dispersal rates and habitat generalist and specialist species. Results: Species distributions for the total species pool on scale levels larger than 1.5 km2 were unimodal, with an overrepresentation of rare species. With decreasing scale level, the proportion of common species increased, leading to weak bimodality. Distributions of subsets of slowly dispersing and habitat specialist species are on all scale levels characterised by a strongly unimodal pattern. The subset of species with high dispersal rates and habitat generalist species has a higher proportion of common species, leading to a significant core peak. Conclusions: On all scale levels both dispersal and niche limitation are hampering the wider distribution of rare species. However, since isolation and habitat heterogeneity are limited on the smaller scale levels, a larger proportion of well dispers- ing and habitat generalist species is able to occupy a high number of patches, resulting in a significant core peak for the total species pool.","2004","2021-10-27 00:26:33","2021-10-27 00:28:11","","321-328","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/P27GNXVZ/bea_jvs_2OO4.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A null model analysis showed that species richness in the plots had an unusually low variance suggesting that beta habitat diversity was not likely to explain the limitation on species richness. Because we did not ﬁnd a correlation between the distribution of species over the slack and their dispersal capacity, we also excluded the dispersal limitation hypothesis. Finally, a guild proportionality analysis revealed that the abundances of forb, graminoid and ruderal species showed low an unusually low variance over all age classes involved.

Increasingly, this has allowed the needs of saproxylic (dead wood associated) insects to be addressed. However, there has been very little equivalent research in tropical forests, where saproxylic insect faunas are likely to be much richer and where forestry is usually subject to weaker environmental controls. This study compares the saproxylic beetle fauna of old-growth, selectively logged and regrowth rainforest in the Daintree lowlands of northeastern Queensland, Australia. Old-growth levels of abundance, species richness, assemblage composition and guild structure were not maintained in logged and regrowth forest, suggesting that intact assemblages may not survive in the long-term in managed tropical rainforest. However, retaining a continuous supply of commercially overmature trees in the managed stand may prevent a repeat of the widespread extinctions of saproxylic insects witnessed in temperate and boreal forest regions. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"GRFDPUUB","journalArticle","","Ivan, J S","Assessing the efficacy of monitoring wolverine on a regional scale using occupancy and abundance estimation","","","","","","Conservation biologists and resource managers are often faced with the task of designing monitoring programs for species that are rare, diffuse, or patchily distributed across large landscapes. These efforts are frequently very expensive and seldom can be conducted by one entity. It is essential that a power analysis is undertaken to ensure stated goals are feasible. We developed a spatial-based simulation, which accounts for natural history, habitat use, and sampling scheme, to investigate power for monitoring wolverines in two areas of the U.S. Rocky Mountains. The first area is a well-established metapopulation of wolverine in the northern Rocky Mountain states of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, where the current population is approximately 350 individuals and there are concerns of population decline. Based on current population size estimates and detection probabilities in the northern U.S. Rockies, most sampling schemes are likely to only detect large declines in population sizes (i.e. 50% decline over 10 years). In general, increasing the number of grids sampled or the per visit detection probability had a much greater effect on power than increasing the number of visits per year. For small populations, we found very low power to detect declines. The second analysis was a forecast of the effort required to monitor an increasing population in the southern U.S. Rockies, given recolonization or reintroduction. Occupancy-based methods can only produce enough power to detect population trends if populations are increasing dramatically (i.e. doubling or tripling in 10 years), regardless of the sampling effort. In sum, our approach provides a spatially based framework to evaluate monitoring protocols and objectives by explicitly incorporating the link between changes in population size and estimated occupancy, all while accounting for natural history of the species in question. These analyses were specific to wolverines, but our approach could easily be adapted to other species.","","2021-10-27 00:36:42","2021-10-27 00:36:42","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/RNEST8FB/Ivan - Assessing the efficacy of monitoring wolverine on .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
