However, few versions of the model relate these probabilities to the occupancies of neighboring sites or patches. We present a modeling framework that incorporates this information and is capable of describing a wide variety of spatiotemporal colonization and extinction processes. A key feature of the model is that it is based on a simple set of small-scale rules describing how the process evolves. The result is a dynamic process that can account for complicated large-scale features. In our model, a site is more likely to be colonized if more of its neighbors were previously occupied and if it provides more appealing environmental characteristics than its neighboring sites. Additionally, a site without occupied neighbors may also become colonized through the inclusion of a long-distance dispersal process. Although similar model speciﬁcations have been developed for epidemiological applications, ours formally accounts for detectability using the well-known occupancy modeling framework. After demonstrating the viability and potential of this new form of dynamic occupancy model in a simulation study, we use it to obtain inference for the ongoing Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis) invasion in South Africa. Our results suggest that the Common Myna continues to enlarge its distribution and its spread via short distance movement, rather than long-distance dispersal. Overall, this new modeling framework provides a powerful tool for managers examining the drivers of colonization including short- vs. long-distance dispersal, habitat quality, and distance from source populations.","2016-01","2021-10-27 03:24:33","2021-10-27 03:24:33","2021-10-27 03:24:33","194-204","","1","97","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/UCFNMVSN/Broms et al. - 2016 - Dynamic occupancy models for explicit colonization.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed the impacts of winter–spring (November–May) cattle grazing on marsh vegetation cover and occupancy of a highly secretive marsh bird that relies on dense vegetation cover, the California Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus), in the northern Sierra Nevada foothills of California, USA. Using detection–nondetection data collected during repeated call playback surveys at grazed vs. ungrazed marshes and a ‘‘random changes in occupancy’’ parameterization of a multi-season occupancy model, we examined relationships between occupancy and habitat covariates, while accounting for imperfect detection. Marsh vegetation cover was signiﬁcantly lower at grazed marshes than at ungrazed marshes during the grazing season in 2007 but not in 2008. Winter–spring grazing had little effect on Black Rail occupancy at irrigated marshes. However, at nonirrigated marshes fed by natural springs and streams, grazed sites had lower occupancy than ungrazed sites. Black Rail occupancy was positively associated with marsh area, irrigation as a water source, and summer vegetation cover, and negatively associated with marsh isolation. Residual dry matter (RDM), a commonly used metric of grazing intensity, was signiﬁcantly associated with summer marsh vegetation cover at grazed sites but not spring cover. Direct monitoring of marsh vegetation cover, particularly at natural spring- or streamfed marshes, is recommended to prevent negative impacts to rails from overgrazing.","","2021-10-27 03:24:47","2021-10-27 03:24:47","","11","","5","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/CLRZDQJ2/Richmond et al. - Impact of cattle grazing on the occupancy of a cry.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite a potentially narrow window of opportunity for efficient management, managers tend to delay intervention because the cost of prompt action is often high and resources are limited. The Barred Owl (Strix varia) invaded and colonized the entire range of the Northern Spotted Owl (S. occidentalis caurina), but insufficient population data contributed to delays in action until the Barred Owl posed an existential threat to the Spotted Owl. The leading edge of the Barred Owl expansion has since reached the Sierra Nevada, the core range of the California Spotted Owl (S. o. occidentalis). We conducted passive acoustic surveys within 400-ha grid cells across ~6,200 km2 in the northern Sierra Nevada and detected a 2.6-fold increase in Barred Owl site occupancy between 2017 and 2018, from 0.082 (85% confidence interval: 0.045–0.12) to 0.21 (0.14–0.28). The probability of Barred Owl site colonization increased with the amount of older forest, suggesting that Barred Owls are first occupying the preferred habitat of Spotted Owls. GPS-tagged Barred Owls (n = 10) generally displayed seasonal and interannual site fidelity over territories averaging 411 ha (range: 150–513 ha), suggesting that our occupancy estimates were not substantially upwardly biased by “double counting” individuals whose territories spanned multiple grid cells. Given the Barred Owl’s demonstrated threat to the Northern Spotted Owl, we believe our findings advise the Precautionary Principle, which posits that management actions such as invasive species removal should be taken despite uncertainties about, for example, true rates of population growth if the cost of inaction is high. In this case, initiating Barred Owl removals in the Sierra Nevada before the population grows further will likely make such action more cost-effective and more humane than if it is delayed. It could also prevent the extirpation of the California Spotted Owl from its core range.","2020-03-10","2021-10-27 03:24:54","2021-10-27 03:24:54","2021-10-27 03:24:54","duz058","","1","122","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/2HMITQJD/Wood et al. - 2020 - Early detection of rapid Barred Owl population gro.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nest-based monitoring is a common, useful approach, but the difficulty and expense of monitoring raptor nests and importance of reliable trend data to conservation requires that limited resources are allocated efficiently. Power analyses offer a helpful tool to ensure that monitoring programs have the ability to detect trends and to optimize financial resources devoted to monitoring. We evaluated alternative monitoring designs for raptors to identify appropriate survey effort to detect population trends. We used data collected from a territory-occupancy study of ferruginous hawks throughout Wyoming to guide simulations and evaluate the ability to detect trends in occupancy rates. Results suggest that greater gains in precision of trend estimation may be achieved through the addition of more sites and not more visits; statistical power was �80% when monitoring lasted 20 years and population declines were 20%; and probability of detection affected statistical power less than rates of population decline. Monitoring at least 150 sites for 20 years would provide reasonable estimates of trend in occupancy given certain rates of detection and occupancy, but only for population declines of 20%. Removal sampling did not result in substantial changes of any metrics used to evaluate simulations, providing little justification for employing the standard design if territory occupancy is the variable of interest. Initial rates of territory occupancy may be biased high, a problem inherent to many studies that monitor territory occupancy. We explored the effects of lower rates of initial occupancy on the ability to detect trends. Although we present data from a study of ferruginous hawks, our simulations can be applied to other raptor species with similar life history and population dynamics to provide guidance for future trend estimation of territory occupancy.","2019-03-22","2021-10-27 03:31:43","2021-10-27 03:31:43","2021-10-27 03:31:43","e0213654","","3","14","","PLoS ONE","Survey design for broad-scale, territory-based occupancy monitoring of a raptor","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/RCBDUIJV/Johnson et al. - 2019 - Survey design for broad-scale, territory-based occ.pdf","","","","Boyce, Mark S.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, however, many predators such as hawks, and in the US coyotes and cougars, have become increasingly common in urban environments. Hawks in the               Accipiter               genus, especially, are recovering from widespread population declines and are increasingly common in urbanizing landscapes. Our goal was to identify factors that determine the occupancy, colonization and persistence of               Accipiter               hawks in a major metropolitan area. Through a novel combination of citizen science and advanced remote sensing, we quantified how urban features facilitate the dynamics and long-term establishment of               Accipiter               hawks. Based on data from Project FeederWatch, we quantified 21 years (1996–2016) of changes in the spatio-temporal dynamics of               Accipiter               hawks in Chicago, IL, USA. Using a multi-season occupancy model, we estimated Cooper's (               Accipiter cooperii               ) and sharp-shinned (               A. striatus               ) hawk occupancy dynamics as a function of tree canopy cover, impervious surface cover and prey availability. In the late 1990s, hawks occupied 26% of sites around Chicago, but after two decades, their occupancy fluctuated close to 67% of sites and they colonized increasingly urbanized areas. Once established, hawks persisted in areas with high levels of impervious surfaces as long as those areas supported high abundances of prey birds. Urban areas represent increasingly habitable environments for recovering predators, and understanding the precise urban features that drive colonization and persistence is important for wildlife conservation in an urbanizing world.","2018-11-07","2021-10-27 03:31:46","2021-10-27 03:31:46","2021-10-27 03:31:46","20182120","","1890","285","","Proc.

Public participation in closing this gap via citizen (community) science has been limited, but bat species that produce low-frequency calls audible to the unaided human ear provide an overlooked opportunity for collaborative citizen science surveys. Audible bats are rare in regional faunas but occur globally and can be under-surveyed by traditional methods. During 2019–2020, we were joined by community members to conduct aural surveys and expand our knowledge of rare audible desert bats in western North America through a structured survey design broadly adaptable for practitioners across the globe where audible bats occur. Our study was integrated into a statistically robust but flexible master sample in use by the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat), ensuring representativeness of data contributions. We used survey results to update a Bayesian species distribution model for the rare spotted bat, Euderma maculatum, accounting for imperfect detection and including land cover occupancy predictors. Detection probability was estimated ~0.7 ± 0.1. Informative priors from a previous attempt to model E. maculatum were leveraged with the new citizen science data to support spatial predictions of occurrence previously impeded by data sparsity and which reinforced the biogeographic importance of arid cliffs and canyons. Our results are preliminary but encouraging, and future surveys can scale up through the NABat design structure and Bayesian modeling framework. We encourage future surveys to use recording devices to obtain voucher calls and double-observer methods to address false-positive detection errors that arise with inexperienced volunteers. Our design and model supported approach to integrating citizen science surveys into bat conservation programs can strengthen both the scientific understanding of rare species and public engagement in conservation practices.","2021-07","2021-10-27 03:35:15","2021-10-27 03:35:15","2021-10-27 03:35:15","","","7","3","","Conservat Sci and Prac","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/UQQKBWPS/Rodhouse et al. - 2021 - Audible bats provide opportunities for citizen sci.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), a species designated as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, occurs on public lands throughout the western United States including Mount Rainier National Park (MRNP), Washington. With virtually no history of timber harvest or large forest disturbance within MRNP boundaries since the park’s creation in 1899, MRNP provides an ideal place to evaluate potential impacts of climate change and invasive Barred Owls (Strix varia) on the Northern Spotted Owl. We used a multi-state, multi-season occupancy model to investigate how Northern Spotted Owl occupancy dynamics and breeding propensity are related to the presence of Barred Owls, local and regional weather, and habitat characteristics at MRNP from 1997 to 2016. Historical occupancy of Northern Spotted Owl breeding territories in MRNP has declined by 50% in the last 20 yr, and territory occupancy by breeding Northern Spotted Owls also decreased, reaching a low of 25% in 2016. Occupancy rates were higher on territories with steeper terrain and breeding rates were lower when Barred Owls were detected within historical territories. Our results also indicated that breeding propensity was higher when early nesting season temperatures during March and April were higher. In addition, the ability to detect breeding Northern Spotted Owls decreased when Barred Owls were present in the territory. Habitat variables from LiDAR were not correlated with Northern Spotted Owl occupancy dynamics, likely reflecting the dominance of old-growth forest in this protected park. This study illustrates the strong relationship between Barred Owls and Northern Spotted Owl demographics and breeding site selection in a landscape where habitat loss by timber harvest and fire has not occurred.","2019-08-26","2021-10-27 03:35:17","2021-10-27 03:35:17","2021-10-27 03:35:17","duz031","","3","121","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/R5GPS3FQ/Mangan et al. - 2019 - Barred Owls reduce occupancy and breeding propensi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In coastal areas with recreational activity, human disturbance may limit use of otherwise suitable habitat. Snowy plovers Charadrius nivosus have a patchy breeding distribution along the coastal areas on the Florida Panhandle, USA. Our goal was to determine the relative effects of seasonal human disturbance and habitat requirements on snowy plover habitat use. We surveyed 303 sites for snowy plovers, human disturbance, and habitat features between January and July 2009 and 2010. We made multiple visits during three different sampling periods that corresponded to snowy plover breeding: pre-breeding, incubation, and brood-rearing and used multi-season occupancy models to examine whether human disturbance, habitat features, or both inﬂuenced site occupancy, colonization (probability of transition from an unoccupied site to an occupied site), and extinction (probability of transition from an occupied site to an unoccupied site). Snowy plover site occupancy and colonization was negatively associated with human disturbance and site extinction was positively associated with human disturbance. Interdune vegetation had a negative effect on occupancy and colonization, indicating that plovers were less likely to use areas with uniform, dense vegetation among dunes. Also, dune shape, beach debris, and access to low-energy foraging areas inﬂuenced site occupancy, colonization, and extinction. Plovers used habitat based on beach characteristics that provided stage-speciﬁc resource needs; however, human disturbance was the strongest predictor of site occupancy. In addition, vegetation plantings used to enhance dune rehabilitation may negatively impact plover site occupancy. Management actions that decrease human disturbance, such as symbolic fencing and signage, may increase the amount of breeding habitat available to snowy plovers on the Florida Panhandle and in other areas with high human activity. The speciﬁc areas that require this protection may vary across snowy plover life history stages.","2013-04","2021-10-27 03:35:20","2021-10-27 03:35:20","2021-10-27 03:35:20","853-863","","4","3","","Ecol Evol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/VFHY9B2V/Webber et al. - 2013 - Human disturbance and stage-specific habitat requi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conserving uncultivated habitats can support ecosystem services, but in Mediterranean biomes, these lands can also increase the area susceptible to wildﬁres. In the world-renowned wineproducing region of Napa Valley, California, wine grape growers install nest boxes to attract American barn owls (Tyto furcata), which may reduce rodent crop damage. Annual monitoring of 273 nest boxes began in 2015, and devastating wildﬁres burned approximately 60,000 ha in the region in 2017, including homes and businesses, as well as some vineyards and uncultivated land. The goal of this study was to determine whether changes in nest box occupancy were attributed to wildﬁres, nest box design, land cover type, or some combination of these variables. Occupancy surveys before and after these wildﬁres revealed changes in habitat selection at the nest scale. Occupancy increased during the study, reaching its highest point after the ﬁres. Owls were found breeding in recently burned areas that were previously unoccupied and modeling results showed that nest box occupancy had a positive relationship with burned areas, particularly with edges of the ﬁre perimeter. Barn owls also consistently showed a strong preference for taller nest boxes that were surrounded by more grassland than other land cover types and a moderate selection for wooden over plastic boxes. These results illustrate an incentive for the conservation of uncultivated habitat, particularly grassland, in vineyard ecosystems, and they provide an example of a mobile pest predator’s response to wildﬁre disturbance. In this case, results suggest an agroecosystem service made resilient to wildﬁre by the owls’ selection of burned and uncultivated habitats.","2021-03","2021-10-27 03:35:23","2021-10-27 03:35:23","2021-10-27 03:35:23","","","3","12","","Ecosphere","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/F6QA4UN9/Huysman and Johnson - 2021 - Multi‐year nest box occupancy and short‐term resil.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We had the opportunity to study the effect of an historic flood on an anuran community in the Missouri River floodplain. We used occupancy estimation to estimate the proportion of wetlands occupied by calling adult male anurans. Three species—the plains leopard frog (Lithobates blairi ), Woodhouse’s toad (Anaxyrus woodhousii ), and Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris blanchardi )—had only minor changes in occupancy rate two years after the flood. Colonization rates for these species were positively associated with wetlands that were shallower near the shore and they did not appear to be affected by reduced vegetation. Three other species or species complexes—the northern leopard frog (Lithobates pipiens), the gray treefrog complex (Hyla versicolor and Hyla chrysocelis), and the boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata)—had greatly reduced occupancy rates two years after the flood. Colonization rates for these species were relatively low, while they had high extinction rates. Colonization rates for these species were not associated with any habitat characteristic we measured. Future flood events will likely continue to make northern leopard frogs, gray treefrogs, and boreal chorus frogs a less important part of the ecological community. While some species may fare well under extreme climate events, such as this flood, that are forecast under climate change scenarios, many species will struggle.","2015-10","2021-10-27 03:35:26","2021-10-27 03:35:26","2021-10-27 03:35:26","art197","","10","6","","Ecosphere","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/B7L9QSU4/Grant et al. - 2015 - Short-term anuran community dynamics in the Missou.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In metapopulations, colonisation is the result of dispersal from neighbouring occupied patches, typically juveniles dispersing from natal to breeding sites. When occupancy dynamics are dispersal driven, occupancy should refer to the presence of established, breeding populations. The detection of transient individuals at sites that are, by deﬁnition, unoccupied (i.e. false positive detections), may result in misleading conclusions about metapopulation dynamics. Until recently, the issue of false positives has been considered negligible and current efforts to account for such error have been restricted to the context of species misidentiﬁcation. However, the detection of transient individuals visiting multiple sites while dispersing is a distinct source of false positives that can bias estimates of occupancy because visited sites do not contribute to metapopulation dynamics in the same way as do sites occupied by established, reproducing populations. Although transient-induced false positive error presents a challenge to occupancy studies aiming to account for all sources of detection error and estimate occupancy without bias, accounting for it has received little attention.","2013","2021-10-27 03:37:51","2021-10-27 03:37:51","2021-10-27 03:37:51","490","","6","40","","Wildl.

Effective management action requires an understanding of the factors affecting the presence and absence of each species so that promising sites for relocation of endangered species combined with eradication of invasive species can be identified. We investigate competing hypotheses about the factors affecting occupancy of the critically endangered red-finned blue-eye (Scaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis; hereafter ‘RFBE’), a native Australian fish with a global distribution that is restricted to a group of shallow artesian springs. RFBE are threatened by competition with invasive mosquito fish (Gambusia holbrooki ), which are steadily colonizing the springs, resulting in local extinctions of RFBE in most cases. While hypotheses about the influences of Gambusia on RFBE exist, none have been tested with a quantitative model. We used a spatially-structured two-species occupancy modeling approach to examine the occupancy dynamics of these fish and tested competing hypotheses on how Gambusia occupancy affected RFBE. Gambusia occupancy had a strong negative effect on RFBE occupancy and colonization potential; increasing the probability of local extinction at a spring and decreasing the persistence probability of RFBE in a spring by 8.0% 6 2.7% (mean 6 1 SE). We found strongest support for the hypotheses that elevation and spring area influence colonization, and that spring area influences patch extinction probability.

In particular, consideration of the spatial allocation of effort is key. We sampled 4 species of stream salamanders intensively for 2 years (2010–2011) in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, Maryland, USA to evaluate alternative distributions of sampling locations within stream networks, and then evaluated via simulation the ability of multiple survey designs to detect declines in occupancy and to estimate dynamic parameters (colonization, extinction) over 5 years for 2 species. We expected that ﬁnescale microhabitat variables (e.g., cobble, detritus) would be the strongest determinants of occupancy for each of the 4 species; however, we found greater support for all species for models including variables describing position within the stream network, stream size, or stream microhabitat. A monitoring design focused on headwater sections had greater power to detect changes in occupancy and the dynamic parameters in each of 3 scenarios for the dusky salamander (Desmognathus fuscus) and red salamander (Pseudotriton ruber). Results for transect length were more variable, but across all species and scenarios, 25-m transects are most suitable as a balance between maximizing detection probability and describing colonization and extinction.

Despite contemporary conservation concern for Golden Eagles, no studies have evaluated potential negative effects of religious harvest on populations of this species. We conducted aerial and ground searches for Golden Eagle nesting territories on the Navajo Nation from 1996–2005, and monitored occupancy and reproductive rates of territories in three study areas: one area where Hopi annually harvested eaglets, and two areas without harvest. We analyzed 9 yr of data (1997–2005) using multi-season occupancy models and generalized linear mixed models to test for differences among study areas in occupancy dynamics, and production of early-season and fledging-age nestlings. We found no significant differences in probabilities of occupancy, persistence, or colonization of territories between study areas. Territories in harvest and control areas produced similar numbers of nestlings early in the season; however, significantly fewer (53%) reached fledging age in the harvested area, suggesting collection of nestlings led to locally depressed fledgling production.

From 2011 to 2018, we used camera traps on the East Foundation’s El Sauz Ranch to assess seasonal habitat use of ocelots relative to landscape structure, configuration, and complexity and other site-level factors in South Texas. Seasonal habitat use and detection were positively influenced by larger mean patch area and lower landscape shape index values. We also observed ocelots were less likely to be detected during periods of drought and exhibited a seasonal trend in detection. Ocelots used woody patches that were larger and more regularly shaped, indicating a preference for areas with a lower degree of fragmentation across the study area. As patches become larger, they will coalesce over time and form larger woody aggregates, which will promote ocelot habitat use. Brush management needs to be strategic as patch area and shape index are a limiting factor to promote ocelot habitat use on working rangelands in South Texas. These results demonstrate the ability to use landscape metrics to discern the effects of spatial structure of vegetation communities relative to ocelot occupancy parameters.","2020-07","2021-10-27 03:38:05","2021-10-27 03:38:05","2021-10-27 03:38:05","555-563","","3","65","","Mamm Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/WG56IB7Q/Lombardi et al. - 2020 - Spatial structure of woody cover affects habitat u.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The situation is particularly complicated with carnivorous species such as mesopredators, which elicit strong positive and negative responses from urban residents. As cities are dominated by anthropogenic forces, socioeconomic factors likely play a major ecological role that has gone mostly unexplored for mammalian species. We used a large database of motion-triggered camera imagery to investigate relationships between landscape and socioeconomic features and the distribution of three mammalian mesopredator species in Chicago, IL. Coyotes and raccoons were most likely to colonize less urban sites, and coyotes were least likely to go extinct within sites with a high average per capita income. Opossum showed somewhat different dynamics, with added availability of habitat and increased housing density decreasing odds of new colonization. In general the socioeconomic variables performed at least as well as the habitat factors tested, indicating that there is a signiﬁcant role of both biotic and abiotic features in driving species distribution in this area. We suggest that new ecological frameworks incorporating both socioeconomic and ecological factors will be needed for the long-term management and conservation of wildlife in urban regions.","2016-04","2021-10-27 03:38:07","2021-10-27 03:38:07","2021-10-27 03:38:07","163-175","","2","19","","Anim Conserv","Urban mesopredator distribution","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/XSQGCLD8/Magle et al. - 2016 - Urban mesopredator distribution examining the rel.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes in occupancy were equally mixed. Five species–mostly granivores and omnivores, but also Black-whiskered Vireo (Vireo altiloquus), a migratory insectivore–occupied more sites in 2018 than in 2015. Twelve species were less common after the hurricanes, including all of the obligate frugivores. Declines in site-occupancy rates were not only more common than increases, but tended to be of greater magnitude.

We investigated the mechanisms driving shifts in the southern range boundary of a forest and snow cover specialist, the snowshoe hare, to explore how its range boundary has responded to shifting rates of climate and land cover change over time. We found that although both forest and snow cover contributed to the historical range boundary, the current duration of snow cover best explains the most recent northward shift, while forest cover has declined in relative importance. In this respect, the southern range boundary of snowshoe hares has mirrored the focus of conservation research; first habitat loss and fragmentation was the stronger environmental constraint, but climate change has now become the main threat. Projections of future range shifts show that climate change, and associated snow cover loss, will continue to be the major driver of this species' range loss into the future.","2016-03-30","2021-10-27 03:53:46","2021-10-27 03:53:46","2021-10-27 03:53:46","20153104","","1827","283","","Proc.

We considered jaguar as dominant predator and puma as subordinate, and expected to ﬁnd spatial and temporal avoidance between them. We found evidence of spatial and temporal coexistence. This coexistence could be a result of a restriction of niche separation between both species, inﬂuenced by the harsh conditions in the Caatinga, represented by a combination of extreme temperatures, scarcity of refuges to thermoregulate, an environment around SCNP with a high level of human disturbance and an apparent increase in prey due conservation policies.

Long‐term monitoring programs applying occupancy approaches, in addition to assessing occurrence probability, improves understanding of other population parameters such as site extinction or colonization probabilities, which elucidate temporal and spatial changes and are therefore important for guiding conservation efforts. In this study, we used multiple season occupancy models to monitor occurrence, extinction, and colonization probabilities for northern yellow‐cheeked crested gibbon Nomascus annamensis in three adjacent protected areas in the Central Annamites mountain range, Vietnam. We collected data at 30 listening posts in 2012, 2014, and 2016 using the auditory point count method. Occurrence probabilities were highest in 2012 (0.74, confidence interval [CI]: 0.56–0.87) but slightly lower in 2014 (0.66, CI: 0.51–0.79) and 2016 (0.67, CI: 0.49–0.81).

Although local site extinctions have occurred, high recolonization probability helped to replenish the unoccupied sites and kept the occurrence probability stable. Long‐term monitoring programs which use occurrence probability alone might not fully reveal the true dynamics of gibbon populations.

Consequently, aspects of the landscape, as well as local stream morphology, are likely to affect riparian and stream communities, including occupancy of semi-aquatic mammals. To gain a better understanding of how changing landscapes may affect the occupancy of semi-aquatic mammals, we sought to identify aspects of the riparian system and stream structure at multiple scales that relate to the presence of beaver (Castor canadensis) and muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), including their interactions with mink (Neovison vison) and river otter (Lontra canadensis). We estimated multi-season occupancy using 103 sites sampled over six seasons (2012–2014) in southern Illinois, USA. We hypothesized beaver and muskrat occupancy was related to multiple aspects of landscape and local habitat including land-cover, water availability, human disturbance, stream characteristics, and the presence of other semi-aquatic mammals. Beaver occupancy varied over time and was predicted by stream size, stream density, and land-cover at the landscape scale. Muskrat occupancy also varied over time and was related to local aspects of habitat including percentage of forest in the riparian area, channel incision, land-cover, and aspects of sediment chemistry. Our results indicate the importance of spatial and temporal variation, scale, and food and water availability for these semi-aquatic species.

Because of the patchy distribution of wild hops and current land use changes, the butterfly is a species of conservation concern. The hops azure is abundant along the riparian systems of the U.S. Air Force Academy (Academy) because wild hops is readily available and most land-use impacts have not reached much of the Academy. However, the riparian systems of the Academy are experiencing increased flooding from off-base, hard-surface development, making it harder for riparian vegetation, like wild hops, to thrive. To describe the prevalence and persistence of the hops azure, we conducted multi-year occupancy sampling to understand habitat-patch occupancy changes, such as patch extinction and colonization, and to identify factors that impact detectability. Wind speed, the area of wild hops, and the amount of cloud cover and solar exposure influenced probability of hops azure detection. Patch occupancy and extinction are influenced by the area of wild hops, suggesting that as host plant patch sizes get smaller, patch extinction increases and occupancy decreases. Detectability and occupancy were higher than expected, and the probability of patch extinction and colonization were extremely low. Management efforts to expand wild hops growth within the hops azure’s range, increase continuity of wild hops expanses, and retain the hydrology that supports wild hops should increase the stability of azure populations.","2020-12","2021-10-27 04:05:09","2021-10-27 04:05:09","2021-10-27 04:05:09","927-934","","6","24","","J Insect Conserv","Multi-year occupancy of the hops blue butterfly (Celastrina humulus)","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/5B9RNLJ2/Schorr et al. - 2020 - Multi-year occupancy of the hops blue butterfly (C.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both local stream morphology and surrounding land use are likely to have important inﬂuences on current occupancy of semi‐aquatic mammals and potentially aﬀect future geographic distributions. We identiﬁed aspects of the riparian system and stream structure at multiple scales that relate to the presence of river otter (Lontra canadensis) and mink (Neovison vison) to better understand how changing landscapes aﬀect occupancy dynamics of these semi‐aquatic mammals and to facilitate future monitoring and management. We estimated multi‐season occupancy using 103 sites sampled over 6 seasonal sampling periods in southern Illinois, USA (44,526 km2) during 2012–2014. We hypothesized river otter and mink occupancy were related to multiple aspects of landscape and local habitat attributes including land cover, water availability, human disturbance, and stream characteristics. Occupancy of river otter was predicted by large stream size, less developed area near the stream site, and proximity to areas with reintroduced or remnant populations of river otter. Mink were more likely to occupy sites with small streams and decreased water availability near the site. However, top models for both species had low weights and high uncertainty for multiple variables. Habitat‐based models may not be the best predictors of occupancy for these carnivores because they are more likely to respond to prey diversity or availability, but landscape changes that decrease natural water availability and increase human disturbance to the stream at the local scale are likely to negatively aﬀect river otter. © 2019 The Authors.

We used occupancy models to explore factors affecting detectability and occupancy ( ), the probability that a species inhabits a site, for three ﬁshes frequently captured in Chesapeake Bay seine surveys: young-of-the-year (age-0) striped bass Morone saxatilis, yearling Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus, and spottail shiner Notropis hudsonius. Twelve repeat-sampling events occurred during the summers of 2008 and 2009 at 20 sites in the Mattaponi and Pamunkey rivers, Virginia. Although the environmental factors that inﬂuenced detection probabilities varied with species, the detectability of all species was positively related to effective net length (i.e., the maximum distance from shore that the seine was deployed). The mean detectability of age-0 striped bass, which occupied nearly every site ( = 0.99, SE = 0.01), was 0.62 (SE = 0.06) and positively related to mean water temperature during sampling. The detectability of yearling Atlantic croakers was negatively related to water temperature at time of capture and was signiﬁcantly greater in early summer than in late summer. In early summer, Atlantic croakers occupied all sampling sites; occupancy decreased in late summer ( = 0.86, SE = 0.08) and was positively related to the mean salinity at the site. Unlike with Atlantic croakers, the mean detectability of spottail shiners was signiﬁcantly greater in late summer than in early summer; detectability was positively related to turbidity at the time of sampling and reﬂected the increased availability of recently recruited individuals. Spottail shiners occupied fewer sites than did the two other species ( = 0.59, SE = 0.21). Seasonal changes in detectability appeared to reﬂect changes in catchability associated with ﬁsh growth.

Distributional shifts have been demonstrated in many ecosystems and taxa, yet the extent and nature of these changes remain largely undocumented for tropical forest mammals. Shifts over short time periods can be particularly alarming in areas of the world where mammals are already under threat as a result of human activities. This is the case for Madagascar, an island where deforestation, hunting, invasive species, and other human threats have resulted in the extinction of several endemic species. Here, we ask, are the distributions of Malagasy mammals changing? We test this by modeling local colonization and extinction dynamics, which are the biological processes that produce distributional shifts. We use camera trap data from the TEAM Network for four species along a 570 m elevational gradient in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. The endemic Eastern red forest rat (Nesomys rufus) declined in overall occupancy while the non-native bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) increased in occupancy overall. The two endemic carnivore species shifted their elevational use: the Malagasy ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) retracted from higher elevations and the Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana) moved to higher elevations, likely in response to anthropogenic pressures. These results show that shifts are occurring and we can detect them with just six years of data.

Subsequently, countries focused on cost-share conservation programs whereby private landowners are paid to conserve or restore their land. In the United States, populations of grassland and shrubland breeding birds continue to decline, despite state, federal, and private cost-share conservation programs. We related avian occupancy to cost-share conservation programs across the Central Hardwoods Bird Conservation Region using spatially explicit patch-scale survey data. Once per year from 2008 to 2012, we surveyed 5303 discreet points for 9 grassland and shrubland breeding bird species using roadside 5-min point-count surveys in 37 counties across 7 states. We modeled pointspecific land cover and heterogeneity in conjunction with cost-share conservation program information using a multi-season robust-design occupancy model. Land-cover covariates were most important in models for species occupancy. For every species except Bell's vireo (Vireo bellii), Field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), and Prairie warbler (Setophaga discolor), addition of conservation covariates to best-supported land-cover models improved occupancy model fit, though effects of conservation programs on occupancy were mixed. Eastern meadowlark occupancy was negatively correlated to the presence of conservation. Alternatively, Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) occupancy was 200% greater when a conservation practice was at a point rather than being located 4 km away. If cost-share conservation is going to reverse biodiversity declines in agricultural ecosystems, then scale-appropriate models will need to be used to prioritize future implementation because the status quo provides limited mixed effects on grassland and shrubland bird species occupancy.","2020-04","2021-10-27 04:16:22","2021-10-27 04:16:22","2021-10-27 04:16:22","108510","","","244","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/D7RBJ7F9/Lituma and Buehler - 2020 - Cost-share conservation practices have mixed effec.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The U.S. Department of Defense manages approximately 29 million acres of land within the continental U.S., and many military installations contain wetland complexes that may be important for wetland birds. Thus, failure to adequately manage habitat for marsh birds could result in species extirpations and additional listings under the Endangered Species Act, and may result in regulatory burdens that reduce military readiness. We conducted spatial analyses to identify important breeding habitat on > 500 military installations for 12 species of marsh birds, with the goal of identifying installations that are, and are not, likely to harbor breeding habitat for each species. We also sought to assess the local value of military installations for species of greatest concern by comparing habitat suitability within installations to that in areas directly adjacent to those sites. We built range-wide, spatially-explicit models of species distribution to project suitability of breeding habitat for marsh birds within and adjacent to military installations. Our results demonstrate that installations with the best marsh bird habitat are geographically aggregated (both among and within species), primarily at sites along the eastern seaboard and within the southern U.S. In addition, only a few sites appear to contain high-quality habitat for most species. Five or fewer sites contained most of the high-quality habitat for 9 of 12 species, whereas most of the high-quality habitat for remaining species was found at � 10 sites. This work fills an information gap regarding the distribution of breeding habitat for marsh birds on military lands across the U.S., and should facilitate both strategic conser­ vation of habitat over broad scales and the integration of marsh birds into management efforts at the site level. Our analyses also identify installations that are not likely to harbor breeding habitat for priority species, and thus should help minimize conflicts between needs of the military and marsh-bird conservation.","2019-12","2021-10-27 04:16:25","2021-10-27 04:16:25","2021-10-27 04:16:25","109664","","","252","","Journal of Environmental Management","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/QI8ZA8SA/Stevens and Conway - 2019 - Identifying important military installations for c.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most sites were visited several times during a breeding season to survey occupancy and later fecundity, but the proportion of sites visited was highly variable over the years. We highlight the power of the Bayesian implementation of site-occupancy models (MacKenzie et al. 2002, 2003) to analyze data from raptor population studies: to correct population size estimates for sites not visited in a given year and for the biasing effects of preferential sampling (when better sites are more likely to be checked). In addition, these models allow estimation and modeling of the site-level persistence and colonization rates, which can provide important clues about drivers of population dynamics, even without individually marking any birds.

We used a camera-trapping network to obtain population estimates for leopards over 2 years through spatially explicit capture–recapture models. Our results, based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian/MCMC methods, reveal that the largest wild population of the leopard was found widely distributed in remnant forests in central Loess plateau. The population is increasing in our study area, and the density of leopards (1.70 (SE = 0.48) − 2.40 (SE = 0.67)/ 100 km2) is higher than other areas of China. According to the analysis of 2 seasonal occupancy models, prey species drive partially the leopard habitat use, predicting that the big cat thrives from the recovery of prey community. However, human disturbances, especially oil wells, seem to have negative impacts on the habitat use of leopards. Speciﬁcally, it is necessary to have joint efforts by the government and researchers to improve human disturbances management and prey species population density, as well as strengthen the investment in research on the North Chinese leopard, which could all further strengthen protection ability and ensure the long-term survival of this species.","2021-01","2021-10-27 04:16:30","2021-10-27 04:16:30","2021-10-27 04:16:30","67-83","","1","16","","Integr.

Notably, many monitoring programs do not establish trigger points or a level of decline in population size that will result in management action. Here we report on the monitoring program for the Flat-tailed Horned Lizard (Phrynosoma mcallii) that has been established across its range throughout the United States by the Flat-tailed Horned Lizard Interagency Coordinating Committee (FTHL ICC). Impor- tantly, we examine whether a trigger point of 30% decline was detected in these populations. Between 2007 and 2013, we detected 955 P. mcallii on 2,714 occupancy surveys and captured 715 individuals on 1,861 demographic surveys. Occupancy surveys have demonstrated that the species occurs through- out the management areas and occupancy estimates range from 0.25–0.89. Demographic surveys have demonstrated that population trends over time are correlated across all management areas; however, they are probably driven by factors at smaller geographic scales. During the study no population decline > 30% was detected after accounting for natural and stochastic fluctuations. Continued mon- itoring is called for to gain a greater understanding of what is driving the trends in populations both range-wide and at the scale of management areas.","","2021-10-27 04:16:37","2021-10-27 04:16:37","","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/ZMVL6799/Leavitt and Collins - Multiyear monitoring (2007-2013) of flat-tailed ho.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identifying the impacts of prescribed ﬁre on bird communities in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests is necessary for providing land management agencies with information regarding the effects of fuel reduction on sensitive, threatened, and migratory bird species. Recent developments in occupancy modeling have established a framework for quantifying the impacts of management practices on wildlife community dynamics. We describe a Bayesian hierarchical model of multi-species occupancy accounting for detection probability, and we demonstrate the model’s usefulness for identifying effects of habitat disturbances on wildlife communities. Advantages to using the model include the ability to estimate the effects of environmental impacts on rare or elusive species, the intuitive nature of the modeling, the incorporation of detection probability, the estimation of parameter uncertainty, the ﬂexibility of the model to suit a variety of experimental designs, and the composite estimate of the response that applies to the collection of observed species as opposed to merely a small subset of common species. Our modeling of the impacts of prescribed ﬁre on avian communities in a ponderosa pine forest in Washington indicate that prescribed ﬁre treatments result in increased occupancy rates for several barkinsectivore, cavity-nesting species including a management species of interest, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus). Three aerial insectivore species, and the ground insectivore, American Robin (Turdus migratorius), also responded positively to prescribed ﬁre, whereas three foliage insectivores and two seed specialists, Clark’s Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), declined following treatments. Land management agencies interested in determining the effects of habitat manipulations on wildlife communities can use these methods to provide guidance for future management activities.","2009-07","2021-10-27 04:16:39","2021-10-27 04:16:39","2021-10-27 04:16:39","1253-1263","","5","19","","Ecological Applications","Modeling the effects of environmental disturbance on wildlife communities","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/8ZI5K66H/Russell et al. - 2009 - Modeling the effects of environmental disturbance .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cryptic shifts in trophic interactions are potentially important but widely underappreciated mechanisms shaping predator population response to habitat change. Here, we assessed the extent to which variation in trophic interactions explained diﬀerences in predator populations at both local and landscape scales. We integrated stable isotope analyses, GPS tagging, and long-term territory occupancy information to characterize the trophic ecology of spotted owls in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA where population trends and densities vary among forest landscapes with contrasting land uses and disturbance regimes. Trophic interactions appeared to inﬂuence spotted owl space use and territory occupancy rates with emergent consequences for landscape-scale patterns in population abundance and trends. Speciﬁcally, consumption of woodrats and pocket gophers, which varied with habitat conditions, was associated with smaller home ranges and lower territory extinction probabilities. Moreover, spotted owls consumed signiﬁcantly more woodrats and pocket gophers in landscapes with stable (national parks) and high-occupancy (private lands) populations than in landscapes with declining owl populations (national forests). Collectively, our results suggest that trophic responses to local habitat conditions can aﬀect predators at multiple spatial scales and that managing for important prey species habitat may beneﬁt predator populations.

Few studies have tested the efficacy of sampling designs on camera-trap surveys for monitoring giant pandas in a heterogeneous landscape. In this study, we conducted camera trapping of giant pandas based on two different sampling schemes in Changqing National Nature Reserve of China, and evaluated their outcomes based on three aspects: occupancy analysis, photographic rate, and activity pattern. The results demonstrated that both climate heterogeneity and distance to the nearest road had a strong positive influence on site occupancy, and slope and forest cover had a significant negative impact on site occupancy. Significant differences in the direction or magnitude of variables’ influences indicated that there were apparently spatial-temporal dynamics of giant panda distribution between two sampling schemes. The low detection probabilities indicated that both sampling schemes were not robust to accurately monitor giant pandas in the whole study area. We recommended that more suitable sampling designs with local covariates be developed for camera-trap surveys monitoring giant pandas to account for temporal variability and small-scale variation in heterogeneous landscapes.","2021-10-03","2021-10-27 04:18:31","2021-10-27 04:18:31","2021-10-27 04:18:31","","","","","","Environ Sci Pollut Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/FUKLFY93/Cui et al. - 2021 - Testing the efficacy of camera-trap sampling desig.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined tadpole assemblages in areas converted to exotic pastures and native wooded grasslands in northern Pantanal wetland, Midwestern Brazil. We tested the differences in site occupancy probability and assemblage composition during a ﬂood season. We registered thirteen tadpole species, but only ﬁve were detected at levels suitable for occupancy modelling. For most species, tadpole occupancy was higher at the beginning of the ﬂood season. Only Scinax fuscomarginatus occupancy was related with vegetation cover. Occupancy probability for three species (Dendropsophus nanus, Physalaemus centralis, and Physalaemus cuvieri) was associated positively with species richness of ﬁsh. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that exotic pastures hosted a different tadpole assemblage than native areas. The assemblage composition gradient was associated with species richness of ﬁsh, vegetation cover and volume of herbaceous vegetation and leaf litter. These differences likely relate to speciﬁc traits of individual anuran species (dietary plasticity, reproductive mode, and habitat preference). The study showed that some generalist species were able to cope with replacement of native vegetation by exotic species. However, management practices have maintained many areas in the Pantanal at a stage of a near-pristine wetland ecosystem and replacement of native vegetation by exotic pastures should be done with caution.","2016","2021-10-27 04:18:39","2021-10-27 04:18:39","2021-10-27 04:18:39","179-190","","2","37","","Amphib Reptilia","Effects of exotic pastures on tadpole assemblages in Pantanal floodplains","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/MK35WVEV/Moreira et al. - 2016 - Effects of exotic pastures on tadpole assemblages .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While camera trapping is a powerful method of detecting presence, it is difficult distinguishing rarity from low detection rate. The margay (Leopardus wiedii) is an example of a species considered rare based on its low detection rates across its range. Although margays have a wide distribution, detection rates with camera traps are universally low; consequently, the species is listed as Near Threatened. Our 12-year camera trap study of margays in protected broadleaf forest in Belize suggests that while margays have low detection rate, they do not seem to be rare, rather that they are difficult to detect with camera traps. We detected a maximum of 187 individuals, all with few or no recaptures over the years (mean = 2.0 captures/individual ± SD 2.1), with two-thirds of individuals detected only once. The few individuals that were recaptured across years exhibited long tenures up to 9 years and were at least 10 years old at their final detection. We detected multiple individuals of both sexes at the same locations during the same survey, suggesting overlapping ranges with non-exclusive territories, providing further evidence of a high-density population. By studying the sparse annual datasets across multiple years, we found evidence of an abundant margay population in the forest of the Cockscomb Basin, which might have been deemed low density and rare, if studied in the short term. We encourage more long-term camera trap studies to assess population status of semi-arboreal carnivore species that have hitherto been considered rare based on low detection rates.","2021-03-01","2021-10-27 04:18:44","2021-10-27 04:18:44","2021-10-27 04:18:44","e0247536","","3","16","","PLoS ONE","Long-term monitoring of margays (Leopardus wiedii)","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/FBD5XJWX/Harmsen et al. - 2021 - Long-term monitoring of margays (Leopardus wiedii).pdf","","","","Yue, Bi-Song","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used data from 41 park-wide line transect surveys in 2009 and 2014 and multi-season occupancy models with multispecies data to explore trends in species richness and distribution of individual species and factors affecting these trends in Nyungwe National Park (NNP), Rwanda. Mammalian species richness and the distributional range of 5 of the 7 species increased between 2009 and 2014 in NNP. The probability of colonization of a species into a new area in 2014, where it was not present in 2009, was highest in sites with a lower probability of poaching activity, close to tourist trails, and at lower elevations. The probability of colonization with no poaching activity was about 50% but dropped to about 10% with a 100% chance of poaching activity. Duiker species had the largest increase in distribution during the study, while there was a decrease in the distribution of the eastern chimpanzee and blue monkey. Our results suggest that increased patrols could be implemented in areas of the park with low species richness and areas with a low probability of occurrence for species of conservation concern to combat poaching activity and thus increase the probability of a species moving into a new area. Our use of a single multi-season model for multiple species explicitly accounts for imperfect detection and species-speciﬁc identities, while allowing for inferences to be made about rarely detected species by sharing covariates with common species. These results can be used to improve conservation planning in NNP for species management and ranger patrol protocols, and our modelling framework is broadly applicable to any protected area with presence/absence species ﬁeld data.","2019-10","2021-10-27 04:22:26","2021-10-27 04:22:26","2021-10-27 04:22:26","503-514","","5","22","","Anim Conserv","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/UYW98IFV/Moore et al. - 2019 - Factors affecting species richness and distributio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objective was to use occupancy models to test whether Florida Crowned Snakes (Tantilla relicta) are a suitable model species for other, more-secretive fossorial squamates. Tantilla relicta are easier to study than other fossorial squamates and likely respond to habitat management (e.g., ﬁre frequency) similarly to these harder-to-study species of concern. We sampled T. relicta using 24 groups of drift fences in longleaf pine–wiregrass sandhills, Ocala National Forest, Florida, USA to assess how habitat characteristics and weather inﬂuenced their occupancy, detection, colonization, and extinction rates. We predicted that temperature, rainfall, substrate composition, and prescribed burn history would inﬂuence T. relicta occupancy, detection, and movement in variable directions. The best-supported multiseason occupancy model included 1) initial occupancy inﬂuenced by time since last burn, 2) extinction and colonization as random processes, and 3) detection inﬂuenced by percent leaf litter and rainfall. Tantilla relicta were most likely to occupy recently burned sites and were most easily detected during dry periods and at sites with low leaf litter cover. Our results are consistent with research suggesting that short-return prescribed ﬁres beneﬁt many reptile species in central Florida’s xeric longleaf pine–wiregrass forests. Further, our results provide modest evidence that T. relicta are suitable model organisms for studying fossorial squamate assemblages.","2019-08-26","2021-10-27 04:22:31","2021-10-27 04:22:31","2021-10-27 04:22:31","179","","3","53","","Journal of Herpetology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/DNDTYBGF/Button et al. - 2019 - Evaluating the Ecology of Tantilla relicta in Flor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used dynamic occupancy models, which allow the territory-specific extinction and colonization parameters – the demographic rates (at the territory level) underlying a population trend –to be estimated. The Swiss peregrine population has developed in line with trends observed in many other countries and regions in North America and Europe: after the pesticide-induced collapse between the 1950s and 1970s, the population largely recovered up to the turn of the millennium. However, in recent years, we detected significant declines again: in SW Switzerland, the population decreased from 51 to 33 pairs during 2008–2015 (-35%), in the N Jura from 70 to 40 pairs during 2009–2015 (-43%) and in Zurich from 6–7 to 2–4 pairs during 2010–2015 (-50%). In the same time, the local extinction rate in the three study areas (more than) doubled from (0.05) 0.1 to 0.2, while the colonization rate dropped from 0.3 to 0.1 in one of the areas, while no change was detectable in the other two. We discuss two factors responsible for these strong, recent declines of Swiss peregrines: (1) predation by Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo) and (2) direct and illegal persecution by humans. In addition to these two factors, growing human disturbance (e.g. through climbers, bird photographers, paragliders, hikers, geocachers, etc.) and fatalities due to collisions with man-made structures (power lines, glass, wind turbines, etc.) are also suspected to contribute to the population decline.","2018-12-01","2021-10-27 04:22:33","2021-10-27 04:22:33","2021-10-27 04:22:33","91-103","","2","26","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/84WX53NR/Kéry et al. - 2018 - Population trends of the Peregrine Falcon in Switz.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These approaches typically rely on the assumption that species are perfectly detected in the field, despite the fact that imperfect detection represents a ubiquitous source of bias in biodiversity studies. This may be notably important in FD studies, because detection may depend on the functional traits used to compute FD metrics. However, little effort has been devoted to account for imperfect detection in FD studies, and therefore the degree to which species traits and detectability affects FD remains poorly understood. We predict that observed FD metrics may either underestimate or overestimate detection-corrected FD, because FD has multiple independent dimensions with different data properties. We assessed whether detection was related to bird traits (body mass, diet, and foraging stratum), accounting for habitat type, season, and phylogeny. We then used a multi-species occupancy model to obtain detection-corrected FD metrics (functional richness [FRic], functional evenness [FEve], and functional divergence [FDiv]), and compared observed and detection-corrected FD estimates in bird communities from east-central Argentina. Some functional types of birds (raptors and insectivores) were more easily overlooked, whereas others (seed and leaf eaters) were more easily detected. Some observed FD metrics underestimated detection-corrected FD (FRic and FDiv), whereas some others (FEve) overestimated detection-corrected FD. Both observed and detection-corrected FRic revealed differences between seasons, but not between habitat types. However, detection-corrected FEve and FDiv showed differences between seasons, contrary to observed estimates. Our results indicate that failure to account for unequal ease of detecting species can lead to erroneous estimates of FD because some functional types of birds are more easily overlooked. We outline some guidelines to help ornithologists identifying under which circumstances detection may be a concern and warn against the indiscriminate use of FD metrics without accounting for species detection.","2020-12-24","2021-10-27 04:22:40","2021-10-27 04:22:41","2021-10-27 04:22:40","ukaa057","","4","137","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/4KXRQL49/Palacio et al. - 2020 - The costs of ignoring species detectability on fun.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
