"Conservation biology of the marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas aurinia","Bulman, Caroline Rose",,="edsble",,="2001",,,,,"edsble.394690",,"University of Leeds","Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","591.7",,"The conservation biology of Euphydryas aurinia was investigated, analysing its metapopulation dynamics, interactions with parasitoids and the efficacy of habitat restoration. Euphydryas aurinia has undergone a widespread national decline in recent years. This decline is quantified at a 10km scale. The distribution in 2020 was predicted for E. aurinia from the 1995-99 distribution, assuming that the current causes and pattern of decline continued. The predicted distribution in 2020 represented a 48% loss in 10km grid square records, with only the core regions surviving. The distribution and persistence of the butterfly was quantified at a regional scale in one, intensively studied area (25km by 25km) in Dorset (England, UK). The metapopulation approach was useful in understanding the occupancy pattern and persistence of E. aurinia within this landscape. The probability of patch occupancy increased with patch connectivity (isolated patches were less likely to be occupied), vegetation height and resource area (patch area multiplied by host plant cover). Such a pattern was consistent with the interpretation that the butterfly persists as a metapopulation. This supported the use of the Incidence Function Model, as a tool to explore the possible fate of E. aurinia in fragmented landscapes in Dorset and in five pairs of independent networks across the species' range in England and Wales. The threshold network area was predicted to be 7 iha, to achieve a 95% probability of persistence for 100 years, for a network within a 4km by 4km area. However, this figure may actually be an underestimate of the area required, if extinction debt is a reality. Parasitoid attack, principally by Cotesia bignellii, appears to have an effect on the population dynamics of E. aurinia and may help to explain the requirement of E. aurinia for large habitat patches. This preliminary work suggests that the parasitoid also has a metapopulation structure and that it is of equal conservation concern. At a local scale the results suggest that the parasitoid and host may have a shifling disiribution, with the butterfly 'escaping' parasitism in some areas. Habitat restoration and re-creation will be necessary in many networks with insufficient habitat area. Experimental investigation into methods of habitat restoration showed that unsuitable but potential habitat may be restored through cutting twice a year in combination with grazing. Habitat re-creation has been shown to be feasible for agriculturally improved sites, but may be more difficult to achieve due to the higher nutrient status and the competitive interaction of other species with the host plant Succisa pratensis.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsble&AN=edsble.394690&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Here, we model expansion rates of a test species (a rare butterfly, Hesperia comma) in five landscapes over 18 years (generations), using a metapopulation model (the incidence function model). Expansion rates increased with the area, quality and proximity of habitat patches available for colonization, with predicted expansion rates closely matching observed rates in test landscapes. Habitat fragmentation constrained expansion, but in a predictable way, suggesting that it will prove feasible both to understand variation in expansion rates and to develop conservation programmes to increase rates of range expansion in such species.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=mnh&AN=19324812&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

These models are parameterized using species presence-absence data from one or more surveys of a habitat patch network. Occupancy models do not include a description of local population dynamics within habitat patches. On the other hand, occupancy models such as the incidence function model and the logistic regression model can incorporate information on the sizes, qualities and spatial locations of habitat patches, and how these patch attributes influence local extinctions and colonizations. For metapopulations in markedly patchy habitats, occupancy models have been used successfully to predict patterns of local extinction and colonization and the persistence of species in patch networks. In such situations, it is doubtful whether more data-intensive and complex demographic models would yield any more reliable predictions than the relatively simple occupancy models. We review the Levins model, the incidence function model and the logistic regression model -- their assumptions, data requirements and types of predictions -- and discuss their advantages and limitations.

In this study, the saproxylic beetle <em>Osmoderma eremita</em> living in hollow oaks was used as a model species and parameterised for a metapopulation model (the incidence function model) at the level of individual trees. The aim was to set up a number of conservation management scenarios, where new oaks were added to increase the quality of the matrix and then simulate the resulting metapopulation occupancy, using three levels of dispersal. A real data set of hollow oaks was used as the base for modeling. Oaks were added to cells in a lattice covering the study landscape, where cell size, cell position and numbers of oaks per hectare were varied. The results show that a larger area of added oaks and a greater number of oaks per hectare will give a higher increase in total occupancy, no matter the dispersal, but the second smallest cell size used (3.4 km2 ) will give the highest response per effort for medium and high dispersal abilities, and smaller cells with greater number of oaks per area can be more effective. The spatial position of the increase in occupancy differs depending on dispersal ability of the focal species and should be considered in conservation management work. For unoccupied cells, the effort required to get the cell occupied will be smaller for cells having a greater number of oaks.</p>","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edseur&AN=edseur.https%3a..www.europeana.eu.item.9200111.BibliographicResource.1000085960033%3futm.source%3dapi%26utm.medium%3dapi%26utm.campaign%3dYuvuWBeCa&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

The results from ENFA reveal that hazel grouse utilize a different and more restricted niche than what is generally available in the study area. When a landscape is fragmented the amount of edge increases, which is negative for many species and thus will affect the amount of available area. The perimeter-area ratio was used to analyze the relative importance of geometric shape. In order to estimate a correlation between incidence of hazel grouse and landscape features census data and land cover maps were analyzed with logistic regression models. It is concluded that hazel grouse is tied to coniferous forest and avoid open areas. However, the result indicates that there is a scale effect that should be considered. The amount of edge in a landscape seems to be important and shape of patches could be a better measure in metapopulation dynamics. In this study the Incidence function model was used to estimate occupancy levels and capacity of a landscape to sustain a metapopulation according to four different area measurement scenarios. Results from the simulations indicate that perimeter-area related measures of patch size combined with capacity could be a more important measure for estimation of population dynamics compared to a basic area measurement. Using a landscape genetic approach, hazel grouse genetic structure, neighbourhood size and dispersal distance were estimated. Genetic estimates of dispersal were in concordance with previous ecological estimates. The results indicate evidence of a population structure reminiscent of what has been found in many other Scandinavian animals with a basic north-south divide. No evidence was found that geographic and environmental structures affected gene flow and dispersal patterns for the hazel grouse.</p>","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edseur&AN=edseur.https%3a..www.europeana.eu.item.9200111.BibliographicResource.1000085949726%3futm.source%3dapi%26utm.medium%3dapi%26utm.campaign%3dYuvuWBeCa&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Observed patterns, such as time-series patterns and spatial patterns of presence/absence in habitat patches, contain a great deal of data on scales, site-history, parameters and processes. Use of these data provides criteria for aggregating the biological information in the model, relates the model explicitly to the relevant scales of the system, facilitates the use of helpful techniques of indirect parameter estimation with independent data, and helps detect underlying ecological processes. Additionally, pattern-oriented models produce comparative predictions that can be tested in the field. We developed a step-by-step protocol for pattern-oriented modeling and illustrate the potential of this protocol by discussing three pattern-oriented population models: (1) a population viability analysis for brown bears (Ursus arctos) in northern Spain using time-series data on females with cubs of the year to adjust unknown model parameters; (2) a savanna model for detecting underlying ecological processes from spatial patterns of tree distribution; and (3) the incidence function model of metapopulation dynamics as an example of process integration and model generalization. We conclude that using the pattern-oriented approach to its full potential will require a major paradigm shift in the strategies of modeling and data collection, and we argue that more emphasis must be placed on observing and documenting relevant patterns in addition to attempts to obtain direct estimates of model parameters.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.3548178&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Spatially explicit metapopulation models considering environmental effects are natural candidates for modelling population viability. However, metapopulations share the inherent uncertainties of the population concept with vague field population definitions. The recognition of the fuzzy nature of populations leads to operational definitions for management purposes. To deal with scarce information and uncertainties in predictions of intervention effects, Adaptive Management is useful. Accordingly, the synthesis of monitoring information is performed with models whose features are continuously adapted to the level of available information. To derive useful indices for conservation strategy evaluation, we propose a novel approach based on the Kullback-Leibler information measure. This is used to evaluate strategies aimed at the conservation of amphibians in an alpine Rhine valley region (Canton of the Grisons, Switzerland) and it is applied to outputs from an incidence function model for Bufo bufo and Rana temporaria. For these species, establishing four additional breeding sites along the Rhine river is a better strategy than placing two additional sites in intensively cultivated land. Artificial ponds in residential areas contribute to species conservation, and transfer of individuals to new sites has advantages over reliance on spontaneous colonization. Bufo bufo and R. temporaria reacted similarly to conservation measures, possibly due to their quite similar ecologies.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=agr&AN=IND44138862&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Representationâbased methods, however, typically consider a static snapshot of species incidences, and the spatial dynamics of the species are ignored. It has been empirically demonstrated that reserves designed using representation do not guarantee another important goal of reserve design: longâterm persistence. The question studied here is the following: Which subset of sites do you select to maximize the longâterm persistence of a species living in a metapopulation, given that each site has a cost and the amount of resource (e.g., money) available is limited? We present an optimization method, which uses a combination of evolutionary optimization (a genetic algorithm) and local search to find the optimal selection of sites. The quality of each candidate solution is evaluated using a spatially realistic metapopulation model, the incidence function model. The proposed method is applied to a metapopulation of the false heath fritillary butterfly, an endangered species in Finland. With this data set, the proposed estimation method produces intuitively acceptable and consistent results within minutes of computation time. Sites favored by the algorithm are located in three patch clusters, and they tend to be inexpensive and initially occupied. Expensive and/or very isolated patches are rarely selected into the optimal site selection.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=agr&AN=IND605875071&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Understanding how species distributions will shift in response to climate change therefore requires techniques that incorporate the combined effects of climate and landscape-scale habitat availability on colonization rates. We use a metapopulation model (Incidence Function Model, IFM) to test effects of fine-scale habitat use on patterns and rates of range expansion by the butterfly Hesperia comma. At its northern range margin in Britain, this species has increased its breadth of microhabitat use because of climate warming, leading to increased colonization rates. We validated the IFM by reconstructing expansions in five habitat networks between 1982 and 2000, before using it to predict metapopulation dynamics over 100 yr, for three scenarios based on observed changes to habitat use. We define the scenarios as ""cold-world"" (only hot, south-facing 150-250° hillsides are deemed warm enough), ""warm-world"" in which 100-300° hillsides can be populated, and ""hot-world"", where the background climate is warm enough to enable use of all aspects (as increasingly observed). In the simulations, increased habitat availability in the hot-world scenario led to faster range expansion rates, and to long-term differences in distribution size and pattern. Thus, fine-scale changes in the distribution of suitable microclimates led to landscape-scale changes in population size and colonization rate, resulting in coarse-scale changes to the species distribution. Despite use of a wider range of habitats associated with climate change, H. comma is still expected to occupy a small fraction of available habitat in 100 yr. The research shows that metapopulation models represent a potential framework to identify barriers to range expansion, and to predict the effects of environmental change or conservation interventions on species distributions and persistence.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.20696332&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

We tested whether an IFM can be applied to quantify spatial habitat requirements for the protection and long-term survival of the tree frog Hyla arborea in Zealand Flanders, using a time series of three consecutive annual distribution patterns and dispersal data. The tree frog is an endangered species in the Netherlands and its distribution pattern is highly fragmented. An extended IFM was developed in which habitat quality parameters were incorporated to estimate functions for colonisation and extinction. A new method to estimate colonisation and extinction functions was developed, using both the turnover events between years and the spatial distribution pattern of the first year of survey. A logistic regression analysis indicated that the extinction probability decreased with pond size and that colonisation probability was higher for large ponds with high connectivity. The observed dispersal distances in comparison with the distances between ponds showed that the habitat network was still connected by dispersing individuals. The extended IFM quite accurately predicted the distribution pattern within a few years. However long-term predictions of metapopulation persistence were probably optimistic. A three-year data set is too short to incorporate the total range of fluctuations of population numbers between years. In addition deterministic extinctions due to habitat destruction and the loss of suitable habitat caused by natural succession were not incorporated in the model. It is concluded that the model could be a useful tool for conservation assessment when comparing different nature restoration scenarios and to provide general guidelines for an optimal tree frog landscape.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.20113255&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Our study focused on the distribution, diversity and abundance of butterflies on 22 isolated plots, mainly consisting of wet grassland. The plots were surrounded by deciduous mixed forests and located in an agglomeration area close to Lake Zurich, Switzerland. In addition to vegetation parameters, we assessed structural connectivity, adapted to least cost distances, using digital surface and terrain models. The resulting mixed-effects models revealed on plot level that (1) Molinia meadows had a significantly positive effect on rarefied Simpson butterfly diversity, (2) structural connectivity had a highly significant negative impact on rarefied Simpson butterfly diversity, whereas (3) plot size showed a significant positive impact, and (4) higher butterfly abundance was strongly related to blossom density. Across plot level, Molinia meadows had a higher rarefied butterfly species richness and rarefied Simpson butterfly diversity than any of the other habitat types evaluated. Among the endangered target species, the preferences of the Alcon Blue Phengaris alcon alcon were consistent with (1) to (3), while those of the Marsh Fritillary's E. aurinia aurinia were not. (2) is discussed with regards to the predominant influence of habitat type, vegetation and plot size, relativizing the effect of structural connectivity on butterfly communities in presumably resilient metapopulations. Ongoing targeted maintenance measures in the study area provide a promising basis for the sustainable conservation of local butterfly communities in isolated wet grassland plots.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=agr&AN=IND607209482&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

However, too intense grazing may have negative effects for example many grassland insects. EU-subsidies for grazing of some habitats, aimed at promoting biodiversity, still require a relatively intense grazing, and could therefore have negative consequences for some species. We quantified how such grazing affects habitat quality for the marsh fritillary butterfly, and how this influence its colonization-extinction dynamics and persistence. Specifically, we studied a metapopulation on Gotland (Sweden), where the marsh fritillary occupies unfertilized calcareous grassland with a naturally slow succession. We quantified the difference in larvae autumn nests between grazed and ungrazed habitat, and used this difference to adjust the ‘effective area’ of 256 habitat patches in a 50km2 landscape. We then parameterized a metapopulation model based on the occurrence pattern of the adult butterfly, and simulated future population development under different grazing regimes. The results showed that ungrazed habitat harbored 4.8 times more nests than grazed habitat. Reducing the ‘effective area’ of grazed patches accordingly increased the local extinction probability and decreased colonization. Grazing all suitable habitat reduced the occupancy by over 80%, while no grazing increased the occupancy by up to 40%, based on projections of future dynamics. Current grazing is clearly too intense, and EU-subsidies are here, thus, a conservation measure with negative consequences for a threatened butterfly. To prevent this, subsidies for grazing need to be more flexible and better adapted to the prevailing soil conditions and requirements of the target species.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=agr&AN=IND606739113&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

We examined the vulnerability of PA networks to climate change by examining connectivity of PAs along elevation gradients. We used the PA network on Borneo as a model system, and examined changes in the spatial distribution of climate conditions in future. A large proportion of PAs will not contain analogous climates in future (based on temperature projections for 2061–2080), potentially requiring organisms to move to cooler PAs at higher elevation, if they are to track climate changes. For the highest warming scenario (RCP8.5), few (11–12.5%; 27–30/240) PAs were sufficiently topographically diverse for analogous climate conditions (present-day equivalent or cooler) to remain in situ. For the remaining 87.5–89% (210–213/240) of PAs, which were often situated at low elevation, analogous climate will only be available in higher elevation PAs. However, over half (60–82%) of all PAs on Borneo are too isolated for poor dispersers (<1km per generation) to reach cooler PAs, because there is a lack of connecting forest habitat. Even under the lowest warming scenario (RCP2.6), analogous climate conditions will disappear from 61% (146/240) of PAs, and a large proportion of these are too isolated for poor dispersers to reach cooler PAs. Our results suggest that low elevation PAs are particularly vulnerable to climate change, and management to improve linkage of PAs along elevation gradients should be a conservation priority.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=agr&AN=IND605361167&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"
