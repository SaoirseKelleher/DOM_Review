"Mid-domain effect for food chain length in a colonization-extinction model","Prillwitz, Kai von; Blasius, Bernd","Theoretical Ecology",="18741738",,="2020","13","3","301","15","edsgcl.633546645","10.1007/s12080-020-00454-x","Springer","Report","Biological diversity -- Analysis; Biological diversity -- Models",,"Keywords: Metacommunity; Spatially explicit; Patch dynamic model; Spatial networks; Food web; Mid-domain effect Abstract The mid-domain effect states that in a spatially bounded domain species richness tends to decrease from the center towards the boundary, thus producing a peak or plateau of species richness in the middle of the domain even in the absence of any environmental gradient. This effect has been frequently used to describe geographic richness gradients of trophically similar species, but how it scales across different trophic levels is poorly understood. Here, we study the role of geometric constraints for the formation of spatial gradients in trophically structured metacommunities. We model colonization--extinction dynamics of a simple food chain on a network of habitat patches embedded in a one- or two-dimensional domain. In a spatially homogeneous or well-mixed system, we find that the food chain length increases with the square root of the ratio of colonization and extinction rates. In a spatially bounded domain, we find that the patch occupancy decreases towards the edge of the domain for all species of the food web, but this spatial gradient varies with the trophic level. As a consequence, the average food chain length peaks in the center and declines towards the boundaries of the domain, thereby extending the notion of a mid-domain effect from species richness to food chain length. This trophic mid-domain effect already arises in a one-dimensional domain, but it is most pronounced at the headlands in a two-dimensional domain. As the mid-domain effect for food chain length is caused solely by spatial boundaries and requires no other environmental heterogeneity, it can be considered a null expectation for geographic patterns in spatially extended food webs.

We have compared using simulations the consequences of two of these alternatives − setting aside young forests or extending rotation periods − to that of current practice in managed boreal forest. In all scenarios we applied a constant conservation budget and predicted forest development and harvesting over 200years. As a proxy for biodiversity conservation, we projected the extinction risk of a dead wood-dependent beetle, Diacanthous undulatus, in a 50km2 landscape in central Sweden, using a colonization-extinction model. During the first century, setting aside young forest stands rather than old stands increased extinction risk because young stands have lower habitat quality. However, habitat quality of young forests increased as they aged and they were much cheaper to set aside than old stands. Therefore, the strategy allowed a larger set-aside area (within the budget constraint), resulting in lower extinction risk and harvested timber volumes in the second century. Prolonging rotations also decreased the extinction risk but was in the long-term less cost-effective. The most cost-effective strategy in the long-term (200years) was to set aside a mixture of old and young forest. However, setting aside young stands rather than prolonging rotations or setting aside old stands delays both the benefits (lower extinction risk) and costs (lost harvest volumes), so the optimal strategy depends on the assumed societal values and hence discount rates.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edselp&AN=S0006320716306012&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

In this paper we utilise a spatially explicit cellular lattice, colonisation–extinction model to investigate the effect of habitat loss, fragmentation and species characteristics on range shifting in response to climate change. Contrary to the predictions of patch occupancy in static climate models we show that fragmentation can have a positive effect on species survival when species have high colonisation rates. For species with low colonisation rates aggregative behaviours prevent success on fragmented landscapes at high levels of habitat loss, and range shifting is more successfully achieved where habitat is correlated. At levels of habitat loss near the extinction threshold, less fragmented landscapes can facilitate range shifting even for the best colonisers. We discuss how imposing a climate window may reduce percolation routes and have implications for the area of usable habitat at any given level of habitat availability. We demonstrate the importance of landscape structure for range shifting dynamics and argue that management of reserve networks needs to consider the requirements of species with different life history characteristics.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edselp&AN=S1574954106000975&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

All models projected increased occurrence in set-aside forest from 2020 to 2110: the projected increase varied between 125% and 195% among models based on CSD, in comparison with an increase of 129% according to the colonization-extinction model.

However, this approach assumes equilibrium between occurrences and environmental gradients, an assumption which is violated during the invasion process, where many suitable sites are empty because the species has not yet reached them. Here we considered the invasive ladybird Harmonia axyridis as a case study to show the benefits of using a dynamic colonization-extinction model that does not assume equilibrium. We used a multi-year occupancy model incorporating environmental, anthropogenic and neighborhood effects, to identify factors that explained spreading variation of this species in France from 2004, when only a few occupied sites were detected, to 2011. We found that anthropogenic factors (urbanization, agriculture, vineyards, and presence/absence of highways) explained more variation in the diffusion process than environmental factors (winter and summer temperatures, wind-speed, and rainfall). The surface of urbanization was the major anthropogenic factor increasing the probability of colonization. The average summer temperature was the main environmental factor affecting colonization, with a negative effect when high or low. The neighborhood effect revealed that colonization was mostly influenced by contributions coming from a radius of 24 km around the focal cell. The contribution of neighborhood decreases over time, suggesting that H. axyridis is reaching its equilibrium in France. This is confirmed by the small discrepancy observed between the performance of our approach and a SDM approach when predicting a single year occupancy pattern at the end of the study period. Our approach has the advantage of explicitly modelling the state of the biological system during the spatial expansion and identifying colonization constraints. This allows managers to explore the effect of different actions on the system at key moments of the invasion process, hence providing a powerful approach to prioritize management strategies.

Yet, these species are often absent from spatially isolated habitats leading to the pervasive view that fragmented ecological communities collapse from the top down. Here we study reef fish from coral reef communities across the Pacific Ocean. Our analysis shows that species richness of reef fish top predators is relatively stable across habitats that vary widely in spatial isolation and total species richness. In contrast, species richness of prey reef fish declines rapidly with increasing isolation. By consequence, species-poor communities from isolated islands have three times as many predator species per prey species as near-shore communities. We develop and test a colonization-extinction model to reveal how larval dispersal patterns shape this ocean-scale gradient in trophic structure.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=mnh&AN=25412873&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"
