The rationale is that crop yield losses occur because the physiology of the growing crop is negatively affected by pests and diseases in a dynamic way over time as crop both grows and develops. Metapopulation dynamics can thus be used to model the resultant crop yield losses. The stochastic metapopulation process is described by using the Simplified Incidence Function model (IFM). Compared to the original IFMs, endogenous and exogenous periodicities are considered in the proposed model to handle the cyclical patterns observed in pest infestations, diseases epidemics, and exogenous affecting factors such as temperature and rainfalls. Agricultural loss data in China are used to fit the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) Model with endogenous and exogenous periodicities is a better fit; (2) When the internal system fluctuations and external environmental fluctuations are negatively correlated, EIL or the cost of loss is monotonically increasing; when the internal system fluctuations and external environmental fluctuations are positively correlated, an outbreak of pests and diseases might occur; (3) If the internal system fluctuations and external environmental fluctuations are positively correlated, an optimal patch size can be identified which will greatly weaken the effects of external environmental influence and hence inhibit pest infestations and disease epidemics.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edselp&AN=S0378437117301814&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

The plots were surrounded by deciduous mixed forests and located in an agglomeration area close to Lake Zurich, Switzerland. In addition to vegetation parameters, we assessed structural connectivity, adapted to least cost distances, using digital surface and terrain models. The resulting mixed-effects models revealed on plot level that (1) Molinia meadows had a significantly positive effect on rarefied Simpson butterfly diversity, (2) structural connectivity had a highly significant negative impact on rarefied Simpson butterfly diversity, whereas (3) plot size showed a significant positive impact, and (4) higher butterfly abundance was strongly related to blossom density.

Disturbances are expected to reduce metapopulation occupancy for species associated with stable habitats, but they may benefit species adapted to transitory habitats by maintaining a dynamic mosaic of successional stages. However, while early-successional species may be favoured by very frequent disturbances resetting successional dynamics, metapopulation occupancy may be highest at intermediate disturbance levels for species with mid-successional habitat preferences, though this may be conditional on species traits and patch network characteristics. Here we test this ‘intermediate disturbance hypothesis’ applied to metapopulations (MIDH), using stochastic patch occupancy simulation modelling to assess when does intermediate disturbance favour metapopulation occupancy. We focused on 54 virtual species varying in their habitat preferences, dispersal abilities and local extinction and colonization rates. Long-term metapopulation dynamics was estimated in landscapes with different habitat amounts and patch turnover rates (i.e. disturbance frequency). Results Equilibrium metapopulation occupancy by late-successional species strongly declined with increasing disturbance frequency, while occupancy by early-successional species increased with disturbance frequency at low disturbance levels and tended to level-off thereafter. Occupancy by mid-successional species tended to increase along with disturbance frequency at low disturbance levels and declining thereafter. Irrespective of habitat preferences, occupancy increased with the amount of habitat, and with species dispersal ability and colonisation efficiency. Conclusions Our study suggests that MIDH is verified only for species associated with mid-successional habitats. These species may be particularly sensitive to land use changes causing either increases or decreases in disturbance frequency. This may be the case, for instance, of species associated with traditional agricultural and pastoral mosaic landscapes, where many species disappear either through intensification or abandonment processes that change disturbance frequency.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsdoj&AN=edsdoj.6008b617f6e44660a5ca95a1c7ae3206&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Según las estadísticas pesqueras, los desembarques han disminuido progresivamente en el último tiempo, para lo cual se han esgrimido razones relacionadas tanto con el mercado, la sobreexplotación del recurso y a la no inclusión de la conectividad espacial de los distintos bancos locales en el manejo pesquero. Por lo que el estudio de la dinámica de metapoblaciones (i.e. la variación temporal de la ocupación de los parches) puede ser una herramienta útil para comprender los patrones de abundancia de aquellas especies que presentan una alta conectividad espacial. En el presente trabajo se realizaron simulaciones para dos escenarios descritos en la zona, para dar respuesta a una serie de interrogantes relacionadas con la conectividad espacial entre bancos, los efectos de la disminución en la conectividad y el grado de incidencia de algunos de ellos. Los resultados nos indican que, al disminuir la disponibilidad de larvas por perdida de la fracción reproductiva, se reduce la probabilidad de colonización, afectando además la probabilidad de dispersión y la incidencia entre bancos cambiando la dinámica de la metapoblación. En una perspectiva temporal, se constato que la población de Juliana paso de tener una alta conectividad entre los bancos a una condición de auto-reclutamiento de algunos bancos particulares de mayor tamaño, tal como se ha visto en otras almejas de importancia comercial. Por consiguiente, es fundamental considerar la conectividad espacial en el manejo pesquero, considerando además los efectos sinérgicos que la extracción de especies de interés comercial pueda generar en los ecosistemas marinos del mar interior de Chiloé. / Tawera gayi (Hupe, 1854), is a bivalve mollusk commonly known as Juliana, whose commercial extraction in Chile is concentrated both in the northern area of the Chiloé inner sea and in the vicinity of the Desertores Islands. According to fishery statistics, landings have progressively decreased in recent times, for which reasons have been raised related to the market and the overexploitation of the resource and the non-inclusion of the spatial connectivity of the various local patches in fisheries management. For this reason, the study of the metapopulation dynamics (ie the temporal variation of the occupation of the patches), can be a useful tool to understand species that seem to have a high spatial connectivity. In the present work simulations were carried out for two scenarios described in the area to answer a series of questions related to the spatial connectivity between patches, the effects of the decrease of patches for connectivity and the degree of incidence of some local population in the Chiloé inner sea. The results indicate that, by reducing the availability of larvae due to loss of the reproductive fraction, the probability of colonization is reduced, also affecting the probability of dispersion and the incidence among patches. This is summarized in a change in the dynamics of the metapopulation. In a temporal perspective, it was found that the population of Juliana went from having a high connectivity among the banks to a condition of self-recruitment of some larger patches, as seen in other clams of commercial importance. Therefore, it is essential to consider the spatial connectivity in fisheries management, considering also the synergistic effects that the extraction of species of commercial interest can generate in the marine ecosystems of the Chiloé inner sea.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edssci&AN=edssci.S0718.686X2018000100007&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

If this is the case, the equilibrium probability of a patch at z being occupied is shown to be close to Ωq1(z)z∈Ω, the equilibrium occupation probability in Levins’s model, at any point Ωq1(z)z∈Ω not too close to the boundary, if the local colonization pressure and extinction rates appropriate to z are assumed. The approximation is justified by giving explicit upper and lower bounds for the occupation probabilities, expressed in terms of the model parameters. Since the patches are distributed randomly, the occupation probabilities are also random, and we complement our bounds with explicit bounds on the probability that they are satisfied at all patches simultaneously.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edssjs&AN=edssjs.AEE866C7&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

The dingy skipper butterfly (Erynnis tages) is a regionally rare declining species in Britain. In the Creuddyn Peninsula (North Wales), it inhabits patches of its host plant, Lotus corniculatus L, growing in lightly grazed areas in sheltered microhabitats, and its regional distribution is dominated by metapopulation processes. In this area, 16 (61%) out of 26.20 ha of dingy skipper habitat are located in reserves. The remaining unprotected habitat is mostly located in wasteland areas vulnerable to urban development. Using a metapopulation model, the incidence function model, I evaluated the extent to which the persistence of the dingy skipper in the landscape could be guaranteed with the existing reserve network. According to model projections, the dynamics within the reserve system were relatively stable when the unprotected habitat remained, with a maximum of 4% simulation replicates going extinct in a 100-year time frame. When unprotected habitat was completely removed, however, the dynamics in the reserve network became markedly unstable, with an increased extinction risk ranging from 15 to 36%. We calculated a relatively simple measure of ""patch importance,"" the colonization potential, for each patch. The incidence function model predicted that for low and medium levels of regional stochasticity (a value from 0 to 0.2), protecting only a relatively small number (four to six) of large and well-connected patches (high colonization potential) in addition to the existing reserves would be enough to decrease notably the extinction risk of the dingy skipper metapopulation. The number of patches needed to be increased (11 patches) for high levels of regional stochasticity (σ = 0.3). My results suggest that long-term persistence of a regionally rare butterfly in a reserve network may depend on the presence of unprotected habitat. For a more realistic estimate of the efficiency of reserves for protecting rare species, conservation biologists should consider incorporating metapopulation dynamics in their evaluations of persistence in existing reserves.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.3591127&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

We use eight bird and two amphibian species as indicator species. To compare scenarios, we present a method combining the output from a metapopulation model with measures of social impacts of land-cover change in a multiple criteria decision analysis.

The modified IFM provided a better, or equally good, fit to species' patch occupancy patterns than logistic regression. Estimated colonization and extinction rates, and the results of logistic regression analyses, varied significantly among species with different life history traits. For example, species with low seed production and predominantly short-distance seed dispersal showed lower rates of colonization and extinction and were more likely to show effects of patch age and connectivity on patch-level presence than species with the opposite set of traits. Model simulations demonstrate a profound negative influence of habitat turnover rate on metapopulation dynamics and persistence, particularly for slow-colonizing species. The incorporation of temporal habitat dynamics into the metapopulation paradigm will permit its application to organisms in a much wider range of real landscapes.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.3450510&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Earlier methods were either ad hoc, produced only point estimates, or could only use turnover information. The new method is based on the assumption of quasi-stationarity, which enables it to use not only turnover data, but also snapshot data. Being Bayesian, the method produces reliable information about the uncertainty of the parameters and model-based predictions in the form of posterior distributions. It is computationally demanding, but considerably faster than a recently developed Bayesian method extended beyond turnover data. The method is compared with existing methods (placed in a Bayesian framework) by fitting an extended incidence function model to a data set on a tree frog metapopulation with many missing values and by predicting its viability, mean occupancy, and turnover rate after 100 yr.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.3108011&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Representation-based methods, however, typically consider a static snapshot of species incidences, and the spatial dynamics of the species are ignored. It has been empirically demonstrated that reserves designed using representation do not guarantee another important goal of reserve design: long-term persistence. The question studied here is the following: Which subset of sites do you select to maximize the long-term persistence of a species living in a metapopulation, given that each site has a cost and the amount of resource (e.g., money) available is limited? We present an optimization method, which uses a combination of evolutionary optimization (a genetic algorithm) and local search to find the optimal selection of sites. The quality of each candidate solution is evaluated using a spatially realistic metapopulation model, the incidence function model. The proposed method is applied to a metapopulation of the false heath fritillary butterfly, an endangered species in Finland. With this data set, the proposed estimation method produces intuitively acceptable and consistent results within minutes of computation time. Sites favored by the algorithm are located in three patch clusters, and they tend to be inexpensive and initially occupied.

We report the results of a study that spans 30 generations (years) of the entire natural range of a butterfly race that is endemic to 35 km2 of north Wales, UK. Short-term studies (surveys in single years and dynamics over 4 years) of this system led to the prediction that the regional distribution would be quite stable, and that colonization and extinction dynamics would be relatively unimportant. However, a longer-term study revealed unexpectedly high levels of population turnover (local extinction and colonization), affecting 18 out of the 20 patches that were occupied at any time during the period. Modelling the system (using the 'incidence function model' (IFM) for metapopulations) also showed higher levels of colonization and extinction with increasing duration of the study. The longer-term dynamics observed in this system can be compared, at a metapopulation level, with the increased levels of variation observed with increasing time that have been observed in single populations. Long-term changes may arise from local changes in the environment that make individual patches more or less suitable for the butterfly, or from unusual colonization or extinction events that take metapopulations into alternative states. One implication is that metapopulation and population viability analyses based on studies that cover only a few animal or plant generations may underestimate extinction threats.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.3067630&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

We used the world's smallest butterfly, the Sinai baton blue (Pseudophilotes sinaicus), as an exemplar of how global warming and human population pressures may act together to cause species extinctions. We mapped the entire global range of this butterfly and obtained extensive data on the intensity of livestock grazing. As with an increasing number of species, it is confined to a network of small habitat patches and is threatened both by indirect human-induced factors (global warming) and by the direct activities of humans (in this case, livestock grazing and collection of medicinal plants). In the absence of global warming, grazing, and plant collection, our model suggested that the butterfly will persist for at least 200 years. Above a threshold intensity of global warming, the chance of extinction accelerated rapidly, implying that there may be an annual average temperature, specific to each endangered species, above which extinction becomes very much more likely. By contrast, there was no such threshold of grazing pressure-the chance of extinction increased steadily with increasing grazing. The impact of grazing, however, decreased with higher levels of year-to-year variation in habitat quality. The effect of global warming did not depend on the future level of grazing, suggesting that the impacts of global warming and grazing are additive. If the areas of habitat patches individually fall below certain prescribed levels, the butterfly is likely to go extinct. Two patches were very important for persistence: if either were lost the species would probably go extinct. Our results have implications for the conservation management of all species whose habitats are at risk because of the direct activities of humans and in the longer term because of climate change.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.3591297&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

This leads to high uncertainty in parameter values and model outputs and complicates the formulation of clear recommendations for conservation management. We present a comprehensive procedure that is able to process spatiotemporal patterns of metapopulation occupancy to rank management scenarios. The first step of the procedure involves the formulation of the stochastic metapopulation model and the estimation of parameter values with a Bayesian approach, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In the second step, the model is used to predict the effects of different management actions, taking into account the uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Finally, in the third step, decision analysis is used to evaluate and aggregate the results of the previous step into a simple rank order of management scenarios. The procedure was applied to a metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary, Melitaea cinxia. Although the amount of available occupancy data was considerable, the uncertainty in the estimated model parameter values was so large that a precise estimate of the extinction risk of the metapopulation could not be made. However, the procedure was able to produce a rank order of management scenarios that was extraordinarily robust to the uncertainty. Application of the procedure to two other case studies revealed that, even though robust rankings cannot always be obtained, the results of the procedure are helpful in assessing the degree of uncertainty in the ranking and pointing to those factors most responsible for the lack of robustness. The results of this paper demonstrate very clearly, by way of example, both the limitations and the possibilities of model-based metapopulation viability analysis.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.4134737&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Mark-recapture experiments revealed maximum cursorial dispersal distances of 280 m for moss dunes and 185 m for higher dune grassland. Higher shrub vegetation appeared to be dispersal barriers. These habitat-dependent cursorial distances and the theoretically estimated ballooning distance were included with patch distances into a connectivity index for both dispersal modes. Forward multiple regression indicated that patch occurrence was influenced by habitat quality and ballooning connectivity. Habitat quality and cursorial connectivity explained patterns in short-term colonisation. Extinction appeared to be stochastic and not related to habitat quality and connectivity.

The majority of connectivity measures used in the recent ecological literature only consider the nearest neighbor patch/population, or patches within a limited neighborhood of the focal patch (a buffer). Meta-analysis suggests that studies using nearest neighbor connectivity measures are much less likely to find statistically significant effects of connectivity than studies that use more complex measures. Here we compare simple connectivity measures in their ability to predict colonization events in two large and good-quality empirical data sets. The nearest neighbor distance to an occupied patch is found to be an inferior measure. Buffer measures do much better, but their performance is found to be sensitive to the estimate of the buffer radius. For highly fragmented habitats, the best and most consistent performance is found for a measure that takes into account the size of the focal patch and the sizes of and distances to all potential source populations. When experimenting with reduced data sets, it was discovered that nearest neighbor measures fail to find a statistically significant effect of connectivity for a large range of data set sizes for which the more complex measures still detect a highly significant effect. We conclude that the simplicity of a nearest neighbor measure is not an adequate compensation for poor performance.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.10.2307.3071919&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Theoretical models assume random dispersal but little is known in practice about the dispersal behaviour of individual animals or the strategy by which dispersers locate distant habitat patches. In the present study, we released individual meadow brown butterflies (Maniola jurtina) in a non-habitat and investigated their ability to return to a suitable habitat. The results provided three reasons for supposing that meadow brown butterflies do not seek habitat by means of random flight. First, when released within the range of their normal dispersal distances, the butterflies orientated towards suitable habitat at a higher rate than expected at random. Second, when released at larger distances from their habitat, they used a non-random, systematic, search strategy in which they flew in loops around the release point and returned periodically to it. Third, butterflies returned to a familiar habitat patch rather than a non-familiar one when given a choice. If dispersers actively orientate towards or search systematically for distant habitat, this may be problematic for existing metapopulation models, including models of the evolution of dispersal rates in metapopulations.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.2665696&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

The construction of a predictive metapopulation model includes three steps: the choice of factors affecting metapopulation dynamics, the choice of model structure, and finally parameter estimation and model testing. 2. Unless the assumption is made that the metapopulation is at stochastic quasiequilibrium and unless the method of parameter estimation of model parameters uses that assumption, estimates from a limited amount of data will usually predict a trend in metapopulation size. 3. This implicit estimation of a trend occurs because extinction-colonization stochasticity, possibly amplified by regional stochasticity, leads to unequal numbers of observed extinction and colonization events during a short study period. 4. Metapopulation models, such as those based on the logistic regression model, that rely on observed population turnover events in parameter estimation are sensitive to the implicit estimation of a trend. 5. A new parameter estimation method, based on Monte Carlo inference for statistically implicit models, allows an explicit decision about whether metapopulation quasi-stability is assumed or not. 6. Our confidence in metapopulation model parameter estimates that have been produced from only a few years of data is decreased by the need to know before parameter estimation whether the metapopulation is in quasi-stable state or not. 7. The choice of whether metapopulation stability is assumed or not in parameter estimation should be done consciously. Typical data sets cover only a few years and rarely allow a statistical test of a possible trend. While making the decision about stability one should consider any information about the landscape history and species and metapopulation characteristics.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.2647347&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

The three most commonly used types of patch connectivity measures differ substantially in how they are calculated, but the performance of these measures has not been broadly assessed. Here I compare the ability of nearest neighbor (NN), buffer, and incidence function model (IFM) measures to predict the patch occupancy and colonization patterns of 24 invertebrate, reptile, and amphibian metapopulations. I predicted that NN measures, which have been criticized as being overly simplistic, would be the worst predictors of species occupancy and colonization. I also predicted that buffer measures, which sum the amount of habitat in a radius surrounding the focal patch, would have intermediate performance, and IFM measures, which take into account the areas and distances to all potential source patches, would perform best. As expected, the simplest NN measure (distance to the nearest habitat patch, $NH_i $) was the poorest predictor of patch occupancy and colonization. Contrary to expectations, however, the next-simplest NN measure (distance to the nearest occupied [source] patch, $NS_i $) was as good a predictor of occupancy and colonization as the best-performing buffer measure and the general IFM measure $S_i $. In contrast to previous studies suggesting that area-based connectivity measures perform better than distance-based ones, my results indicate that the exclusion of vacant habitat patches from calculations is the key to improved measure performance. I highlight several problems with the parameterization and use of IFM measures and suggest that models based on NS/are equally powerful and more practical for many conservation applications.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.40347271&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Cost-distance metrics have been developed to integrate habitat quality into measures of connectivity, and thus may improve predictive power of the area-isolation paradigm. Few studies use empirical data to compare predictive performance of complex cost-distance metrics to simple metrics relying on Euclidean distances. We used 3 years of presence–absence data to examine relative influence of habitat quality, habitat area, and connectivity on occupancy and extinction rates for Poliocitellus franklinii (Franklin’s ground squirrel), a rare grassland species of conservation concern. We calculated connectivity using nearest-neighbor (NN) and incidence function model (IFM) metrics based on Euclidean and cost-distances. Habitat quality, area, and connectivity were all positive predictors for occupancy, but only isolation was a positive predictor of extinction. P. franklinii does not appear to be a tallgrass prairie obligate, but the species distribution is limited by isolation of suitable grassland habitat. A simple NN metric measuring Euclidean distance between a target area and nearest occupied source outperformed IFM (Euclidean and cost-distance) in predicting occupancy and extinction for P. franklinii.

We use metapopulations of the marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas aurinia in the United Kingdom as a model system to test for extinction debt in a declining species. We derive parameters for a metapopulation model (incidence function model, IFM) using information from a 625-km² landscape where habitat patch occupancy, colonization, and extinction rates for E. aurinia depend on patch connectivity, area, and quality. We then show that habitat networks in six extant metapopulations in 16-km² squares were larger, had longer modeled persistence times (using IFM), and higher metapopulation capacity ${\rm{(\lambda }}_{\rm{M}} )$ than six extinct metapopulations. However, there was a >99% chance that one or more of the six extant metapopulations would go extinct in 100 years in the absence of further habitat loss. For 11 out of 12 networks, minimum areas of habitat needed for 95% persistence of metapopulation simulations after 100 years ranged from 80 to 142 ha (~5-9% of land area), depending on the spatial location of habitat. The area of habitat exceeded the estimated minimum viable metapopulation size (MVM) in only two of the six extant metapopulations, and even then by only 20%. The remaining four extant networks were expected to suffer extinction in 15-126 years. MVM was consistently estimated as ~5% of land area based on a sensitivity analysis of IFM parameters and was reduced only marginally (to ~4%) by modeling the potential impact of long-distance colonization over wider landscapes. The results suggest a widespread extinction debt among extant metapopulations of a declining species, necessitating conservation management or reserve designation even in apparent strongholds. For threatened species, metapopulation modeling is a potential means to identify landscapes near to extinction thresholds, to which conservation measures can be targeted for the best chance of success.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.40062046&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Connectivity in plants is commonly modeled as a function of the physical distance between patches, without testing alternative dispersal vectors. In addition, pre- and post-dispersal processes such as seed production and establishment are likely to affect patch colonization rates. Here, we test alternative models of potential functional connectivity with different assumptions on source patch effects (patch area and species occupancy) and dispersal (relating to distance among patches, matrix composition, and sheep grazing routes) against empirical patch colonization rates at the community level (actual functional connectivity), accounting for post-dispersal effects in terms of structural elements providing regeneration niches for establishment. Our analyses are based on two surveys in 1989 and in 2009 of 48 habitat specialist plants in 62 previously abandoned calcareous grassland patches in the Southern Franconian Alb in Bavaria, Germany. The best connectivity model Si, as identified by multi-model inference, combined distance along sheep grazing routes including consistently and intermittently grazed patches with mean species occupancy in 1989 as a proxy for pre-dispersal effects. Community-level patch colonization rates depended to equal degrees on connectivity and post-dispersal process. Our study highlights that actual functional connectivity of calcareous grassland communities cannot be approximated by structural connectivity based on physical distance alone, and modeling of functional connectivity needs to consider pre- and post-dispersal processes.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edssjs&AN=edssjs.33EB7394&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

The water vole, Arvicola amphibius, is one such species. Water voles have recently undergone a significant decline in the UK, as a result of habitat loss and predation from the introduced American mink, Neovison vison. Large reed bed and grazing marsh sites can provide refuge habitats for water voles from mink predation, in which case populations within these sites could sustain metapopulations in the surrounding landscape where conditions are less favourable. We carried out a study using a stochastic patch occupancy model to determine the long term viability of water vole metapopulations in the wider landscape around a series of extensive reed bed and grazing marsh sites designated as National Key Sites for water voles. The results of our model simulations show that a large protected core site, or mainland, is essential in maintaining the long term viability of these systems. Our results also show how these metapopulations could be enhanced by increasing patch numbers through habitat creation and/or restoration and suggest what the minimum effective size of created or restored patches should be. The study shows how population modelling can provide insight into some effective practical ways of enhancing the viability of water vole metapopulations at the landscape scale. Furthermore it demonstrates that extensive wetlands are an appropriate focus for water vole conservation measures.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edssjs&AN=edssjs.E84A25A7&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

We develop a metapopulation model for successional-type systems, in which habitat quality changes over time in a predictable fashion. The occupancy and recruitment of the predatory saproxylic (dependent on dead wood) beetle Harminius undulatus was studied in a managed boreal forest landscape, covering 24449 ha, in central Sweden. In a first step, we analyzed the beetle's occupancy pattern in relation to stand characteristics, and the amounts of present and past habitat in the surrounding landscape. Managed forest is suitable habitat when ≥60 years old, and immediately after cutting, but not between the ages of 10 and 60 years. The observed occupancy of H. undulatus was positively correlated with the stand's age as habitat. We used a metapopulation model to predict the current probability of occurrence in each forest stand, given the spatiotemporal distribution of suitable forest stands during the last 50 years. Metapopulation parameters were estimated by matching predicted spatial distributions with observed spatial distributions. The model predicted observed spatial distributions better than a similar model that assumed constant habitat quality of each forest stand. Thus, metapopulation models for successional-type systems, such as dead wood dependent organisms in managed forest landscapes, should include habitat dynamics. An estimated 82% of the landscape-wide recruitment took place in managed stands, which covered 87% of the forest area, in comparison with 18% in unmanaged stands, which covered 13% of the forest area. Among the managed stand types, 2265;60-year-old stands and 3-7-year-old clear-cuttings contributed to 79% of the total recruitment while 8-59-year-old stands only contributed 3%. The results suggest the following guidelines to improve conditions for H. undulatus and other species with similar habitat requirements: (1) the proportion of the landscape constituted by younger stands should not be allowed to grow too large, (2) the rotation period of managed stands should not be allowed to be too short, and (3) dead wood should be retained and created at final cutting.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.40061849&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Expansion of commodity crops, such as oil palm, fragments natural habitat areas, and strategies are needed to improve habitat connectivity in agricultural landscapes. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) voluntary certification system requires that growers identify and conserve forest patches identified as High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) before oil palm plantations can be certified as sustainable. We assessed the potential benefits of these conservation set‐asides for forest connectivity.We mapped HCVAs and quantified their forest cover in 2015. To assess their contribution to forest connectivity, we modelled range expansion of forest‐dependent populations with five dispersal abilities spanning those representative of poor dispersers (e.g. flightless insects) to more mobile species (e.g. large birds or bats) across 70 plantation landscapes in Borneo.Because only 21% of HCVA area was forested in 2015, these conservation set‐asides currently provide few connectivity benefits. Compared to a scenario where HCVAs contain no forest (i.e. a no‐RSPO scenario), current HCVAs improved connectivity by ~3% across all dispersal abilities. However, if HCVAs were fully reforested, then overall landscape connectivity could improve by ~16%. Reforestation of HCVAs had the greatest benefit for poor to intermediate dispersers (0.5–3 km per generation), generating landscapes that were up to 2.7 times better connected than landscapes without HCVAs. By contrast, connectivity benefits of HCVAs were low for highly mobile populations under current and reforestation scenarios, because range expansion of these populations was generally successful regardless of the amount of forest cover.Synthesis and applications. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) requires that High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) be set aside to conserve biodiversity, but HCVAs currently provide few connectivity benefits because they contain relatively little forest. However, reforested HCVAs have the potential to improve landscape connectivity for some forest species (e.g. winged insects), and we recommend active management by plantation companies to improve forest quality of degraded HCVAs (e.g. by enrichment planting). Future revisions to the RSPO's Principles and Criteria should also ensure that large (i.e. with a core area >2 km2) HCVAs are reconnected to continuous tracts of forest to maximize their connectivity benefits.

Since a specially tailored model cannot be developed for every threatened population, generic models have been designed which can be parameterised and analysed by non-modellers. These generic models compromise on detail so that they can be used for a wide range of species. However, generic models have been criticised because they can be employed without the user being fully aware of the concepts, methods, potentials, and limitations of PVA. Here, we present the conception of a new generic software package for metapopulation viability analysis, META-X. This conception is based on three elements, which take into account the criticism of earlier generic PVA models: (1) comparative simulation experiments; (2) an occupancy-type model structure which ignores details of local population dynamics (these details are integrated in external submodels); and (3) a unifying currency to quantify persistence and viability, the ‘intrinsic mean time to extinction’. The rationale behind these three elements is explained and demonstrated by exemplary applications of META-X in the three fields for which META-X has been designed: teaching, risk assessment in the field, and planning. The conception of META-X is based on the notion that PVA is a tool to deal with rather than to overcome uncertainty. The purpose of PVA is to produce relative, not absolute, assessments of extinction risk which support, but do not supplant, management decisions.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edssjs&AN=edssjs.42A5ABBD&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Mark-recapture experiments revealed maximum cursorial dispersal distances of 280 m for moss dunes and 185 m for higher dune grassland. Higher shrub vegetation appeared to be dispersal barriers. These habitat-dependant cursorial distances and the theoretically estimated ballooning distance were included with patch distances into a connectivity index for both dispersal modes. Forward multiple regression indicated that patch occurrence was influenced by habitat quality and ballooning connectivity. Habitat quality and cursorial connectivity explained patterns in short-term colonisation. Extinction appeared to be stochastic and not related to habitat quality and connectivity.

Models are needed for understanding and predicting metapopulation dynamics in changing landscapes. One particularly important question is what is the effect of habitat loss to the persistence of a metapopulation. A class of metapopulation models that have been successfully used in practical applications are called stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs), which model the presence/absence of the species on habitat patches as a Markov chain. The presence–absence assumption makes the model relatively parameter sparse, facilitates empirical data collection, and enables rigorous parameter estimation. This study reviews theory of SPOMs and describes a computational tool, called SPOMSIM, which allows one to simulate SPOMs and estimate parameters for them. SPOMSIM offers a range of choices for submodels; alternatives are provided for the functional forms of local extinction, the dispersal kernel, computation of connectivity, the colonization function, the implementation of the rescue effect and the implementation of regional stochasticity. SPOMSIM includes also, among other things, a utility based on hierarchical clustering for the analysis of the structure of a patch network, a reserve network optimization algorithm, and a patch system editor which makes it possible to investigate the consequences of changes in landscape structure.

The dingy skipper butterfly (Erynnis tages ) is a regionally rare declining species in Britain. In the Creuddyn Peninsula (North Wales), it inhabits patches of its host plant, Lotus corniculatus L., growing in lightly grazed areas in sheltered microhabitats, and its regional distribution is dominated by metapopulation processes. In this area, 16 (61%) out of 26.20 ha of dingy skipper habitat are located in reserves. The remaining unprotected habitat is mostly located in wasteland areas vulnerable to urban development. Using a metapopulation model, the incidence function model, I evaluated the extent to which the persistence of the dingy skipper in the landscape could be guaranteed with the existing reserve network. According to model projections, the dynamics within the reserve system were relatively stable when the unprotected habitat remained, with a maximum of 4% simulation replicates going extinct in a 100-year time frame. When unprotected habitat was completely removed, however, the dynamics in the reserve network became markedly unstable, with an increased extinction risk ranging from 15 to 36%. We calculated a relatively simple measure of “patch importance,” the colonization potential, for each patch. The incidence function model predicted that for low and medium levels of regional stochasticity (σ value from 0 to 0.2), protecting only a relatively small number (four to six) of large and well-connected patches (high colonization potential) in addition to the existing reserves would be enough to decrease notably the extinction risk of the dingy skipper metapopulation. The number of patches needed to be increased (11 patches) for high levels of regional stochasticity (σ= 0.3). My results suggest that long-term persistence of a regionally rare butterfly in a reserve network may depend on the presence of unprotected habitat. For a more realistic estimate of the efficiency of reserves for protecting rare species, conservation biologists should consider incorporating metapopulation dynamics in their evaluations of persistence in existing reserves.

La mariposa Erynnis tages es una especie en declinación regionalmente rara en Inglaterra. En la Península Creuddyn (Gales del Norte), habita en parches de su planta hospedera, Lotus corniculatus L., que crecen en microhábitats protegidos en áreas con pastoreo ligero, y su distribución regional esta controlada por procesos metapoblacionales. En estáárea, 16 (61%) de 26.20 ha de hábitat de la mariposa están localizadas en reservas. El hábitat no protegido restante está localizado principalmente en áreas no cultivables vulnerables al desarrollo urbano. Utilizando un modelo metapoblacional, el modelo de función de incidencia, evalué el grado en que se puede garantizar la persistencia de Erynnis tages en el paisaje con la red actual de reservas. De acuerdo con las proyecciones del modelo, las dinámicas al interior de las reservas eran relativamente estables cuando permanecía el hábitat no protegido, con la extinción de un máximo de 4% de réplicas simuladas en un marco de tiempo de 100 años. Sin embargo, cuando el hábitat no protegido era totalmente removido, las dinámicas dentro de la red de reservas se volvían marcadamente inestables, con mayor riesgo de extinción que varió entre 15 y 36%. Calculamos una medida de “importancia del parche” relativamente simple, el potencial de colonización, para cada parche. El modelo de función de incidencia predijo que, para niveles bajos y medios de estocasticidad regional (valor σ de 0 a 2), la protección de solo un número relativamente pequeño (cuatro a seis) de parches grandes y bien conectados (alto potencial de colonización) además de las reservas existentes sería suficiente para reducir el riesgo de extinción de la metapoblación de Erynnis tages notablemente. El número de parches tendría que incrementar (11 parches) para niveles altos de estocasticidad regional (σ= 0.3). Mis resultados sugieren que la persistencia a largo plazo de una mariposa regionalmente rara en una red de reservas puede depender de la presencia de hábitat no protegido. Para una estimación más realista de la eficiencia de las reservas para la protección de especies raras, los biólogos de la conservación deberían considerar la incorporación de la dinámica metapoblacional en sus evaluaciones de persistencia en las reservas actuales.

For increasing our understanding of the metapopulation dynamics of sessile species confined to dynamic patches, we fitted a Bayesian incidence function model extended for dynamic landscapes to snapshot data on five epiphytic lichens among 2083 mapped oaks (dynamic patches). We estimate the age at which trees become suitable patches for different species, which defines their niche breadth (number of suitable trees). We show that the colonization rates were generally low, but increased with increasing connectivity in accordance with metapopulation theory. The rates were related to species traits, and we show, for the first time, that they are higher for species with wide niches and small dispersal propagules than for species with narrow niches or large propagules. We also show frequent long-distance dispersal in epiphytes by quantifying the relative importance of local dispersal and background deposition of dispersal propagules. Local stochastic extinctions from intact trees were negligible in all study species, and thus, the extinction rate is set by the rate of patch destruction (tree fall). These findings mean that epiphyte metapopulations may have slow colonization-extinction dynamics that are explained by connectivity, species traits, and patch dynamics.

A key benefit of the IFM is low data requirements: widely available species occurrence data and information about land cover. Citizen science is a promising source of such data; however, to use these data in the IFM there are typically two problems. First, the spatial resolution is too coarse, but existing approaches to downscaling species data tend not to extend to patch level (as required by the IFM). Second, widely available citizen science data typically report species' presences only. We devise ten different downscaling methods based on theoretical ecological relationships (the species–area relationship and the distance decay of similarity), and test them against each other. The better performing downscaling methods were based on patch area, rather than distance from other occupied patches. These methods allow data at a coarse resolution to be used in the IFM for comparing conservation management and development plans. Further field testing is required to establish the degree to which results of these new methods can be treated as definitive spatially-explicit predictions. To address the issue of false absences, we present a method to estimate the probability that all species have been listed (and thus that a species' absence from the list represents a true absence), using the species-accumulation curve. This measure of confidence in absence helps both to objectively identify a habitat network for fitting the IFM, and to target areas for further species recording.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edselp&AN=S0006320715300951&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Spatially explicit metapopulation models considering environmental effects are natural candidates for modelling population viability. However, metapopulations share the inherent uncertainties of the population concept with vague field population definitions. The recognition of the fuzzy nature of populations leads to operational definitions for management purposes. To deal with scarce information and uncertainties in predictions of intervention effects, Adaptive Management is useful. Accordingly, the synthesis of monitoring information is performed with models whose features are continuously adapted to the level of available information. To derive useful indices for conservation strategy evaluation, we propose a novel approach based on the Kullback–Leibler information measure. This is used to evaluate strategies aimed at the conservation of amphibians in an alpine Rhine valley region (Canton of the Grisons, Switzerland) and it is applied to outputs from an incidence function model for Bufo bufo and Rana temporaria. For these species, establishing four additional breeding sites along the Rhine river is a better strategy than placing two additional sites in intensively cultivated land. Artificial ponds in residential areas contribute to species conservation, and transfer of individuals to new sites has advantages over reliance on spontaneous colonization. Bufo bufo and R. temporaria reacted similarly to conservation measures, possibly due to their quite similar ecologies.

Here we present a generally applicable, modified version of Flanski's Incidence Function Model (IFM) that incorporates landscape dynamics (i.e., habitat patch turnover), and we parameterize the model with data on patch occupancy patterns for forest plants in central Lincolnshire, UK. The modified IFM provided a better, or equally good, fit to species' patch occupancy patterns than logistic regression. Estimated colonization and extinction rates, and the results of logistic regression analyses, varied significantly among species with different life history traits. For example, species with low seed production and predominantly short-distance seed dispersal showed lower rates of colonization and extinction and were more likely to show effects of patch age and connectivity on patch-level presence than species with the opposite set of traits. Model simulations demonstrate a profound negative influence of habitat turnover rate on metapopulation dynamics and persistence, particularly for slow-colonizing species. The incorporation of temporal habitat dynamics into the metapopulation paradigm will permit its application to organisms in a much wider range of real landscapes.

Method: The cohort was selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Cumulative incidence function model and multivariate Fine-Gray regression for proportional hazards modeling of the subdistribution hazard (SH) model were used to estimate the prognosis. An SH model based nomogram was built after a variable selection process. The validation of the nomogram was conducted by discrimination and calibration with 1,000 bootstraps. Results: We included 8,983 CRC patients who had KRAS testing. SH model found that KRAS mutant patients had worse CSS than KRAS wild type patients in overall cohort (HR = 1.10 (95% CI [1.04-1.17]), p < 0.05), and in subgroups that comprised stage III CRC (HR = 1.28 (95% CI [1.09-1.49]), p < 0.05) and stage IV CRC (HR = 1.14 (95% CI [1.06-1.23]), p < 0.05), left side colon cancer (HR = 1.28 (95% CI [1.15-1.42]), p < 0.05) and rectal cancer (HR = 1.23 (95% CI [1.07-1.43]), p < 0.05). We built the SH model based nomogram, which showed good accuracy by internal validation of discrimination and calibration. Calibration curves represented good agreement between the nomogram predicted CRC caused death and actual observed CRC caused death. The time dependent area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was over 0.75 for the nomogram. Conclusion: This is the first population based competing risk study on the association between KRAS mutation status and the CRC prognosis. The mutation of KRAS indicated a poor prognosis of CRC patients. The current competing risk nomogram would help physicians to predict cancer specific death of CRC patients who had KRAS testing.

Modelling growth strategies among tropical trees is an important objective in predicting the response of tree dynamics to selective logging and in gaining insights into the ecological processes that structure tree communities in managed tropical forests. 2. We developed a disturbance index to model the effects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps. 3. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0·25 to 6·47 mm year−1, with an average growth of 2·29 mm year−1. Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species. 4. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was significantly positive for 27 species. The effect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year−1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year−1). 5. Functional traits explained 19–42% of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species’ response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response. 6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests.

We define and analyze two simple and ecologically intuitive measures of the capacity of the habitat patch network to support a viable metapopulation. Metapopulation persistence capacity λM defines the threshold condition for long-term metapopulation persistence as λM>δ, where δ is defined by the extinction and colonization rate parameters of the focal species. Metapopulation invasion capacity λI sets the condition for successful invasion of an empty network from one small local population as λI>δ. The metapopulation capacities λM and λI are defined as the leading eigenvalue or a comparable quantity of an appropriate “landscape” matrix. Based on these definitions, we present a classification of a very general class of deterministic, continuous-time and discrete-time metapopulation models. Two specific models are analyzed in greater detail: a spatially realistic version of the continuous-time Levins model and the discrete-time incidence function model with propagule size-dependent colonization rate and a rescue effect. In both models we assume that the extinction rate increases with decreasing patch area and that the colonization rate increases with patch connectivity. In the spatially realistic Levins model, the two types of metapopulation capacities coincide, whereas the incidence function model possesses a strong Allee effect characterized by λI=0. For these two models, we show that the metapopulation capacities can be considered as simple sums of contributions from individual habitat patches, given by the elements of the leading eigenvector or comparable quantities. We may therefore assess the significance of particular habitat patches, including new patches that might be added to the network, for the metapopulation capacities of the network as a whole. We derive useful approximations for both the threshold conditions and the equilibrium states in the two models. The metapopulation capacities and the measures of the dynamic significance of particular patches can be calculated for real patch networks for applications in metapopulation ecology, landscape ecology, and conservation biology.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edselp&AN=S0040580901915485&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

In order to realise these opportunities and apply them to conservation programmes, it is necessary to understand the dynamics involved and to estimate which capacity is high enough to sustain a population at the landscape level. In a regional population consisting of several subpopulations, the incidence function model (IFM) is a stochastic, spatially-realistic patch occupancy model which can be applied using few parameters. With this model one can simulate and manipulate a patch network for a species. In IFM, the extinction probability is assumed to be proportional to local population size which in turn is assumed to be proportional to the local patch area. Although, the basic area of patches is of importance, influence from the geometric shape of patches may be equally or more important to determine potential incidence of a species in a particular patch. Basic area measurements might overestimate the probability of occupancy and/or capacity of a certain patch network to sustain a metapopulation. One applicable method to use in dealing with regional dynamics in fragmented landscapes is metapopulation capacity; derived from metapopulation theory, this method can be used to rank different patch networks. In our study, we examine if there is any difference in occupancy level and capacity between four different area scenarios. This allows us to determine if the basic area measurement of patches can result in a biased estimation of population viability in a specific landscape. It is concluded that perimeter-area related measures of patch size combined with capacity could be a more important measure for estimation of population dynamics and impact of landscape changes compared to basic area measurement and occupancy levels.

The choice as to which type of model to employ in a particular situation, is however, far too often governed by logistic constraints and the personal preferences of the modeller, rather than by a critical evaluation of model performance. We present a comparison of three common spatial simulation approaches (patch-based incidence-function model (IFM), individual-based movement model (IBMM), individual-based population model including detailed behaviour and demographics (IBPM)). The IBPM was analysed in two versions (IBPM_st and IBPM_dyn). Both assumed spatial heterogeneity of the matrix, but the IBPM_dyn in addition included temporal matrix dynamics. The models were developed with a shared minimum objective, namely to predict dynamics of individuals or populations in space given a specific configuration of habitat patches. We evaluated how the choice of model influenced predictions regarding the effect of patch and corridor configuration on dispersal probabilities and the number of successful immigrants of a simulated small mammal. Model results were analysed both at the level of the entire habitat network and at the level of individual patches. All models produced similar rankings of alternative habitat networks, but large discrepancies existed between absolute estimates of dispersal probabilities and the number of successful immigrants predicted by the different models. Generally, predicted dispersal probabilities were highest in the IBMM, intermediate in the IFM and the IBPM_st and lowest in the IBPM_dyn. Observed differences were due both to differences in implementation (e.g. raster versus vector-based movement algorithms), the chosen level of detail in landscape representation (e.g. matrix complexity) and the degree of behavioural realism included in the models (e.g. demography, differentiated mortality). The advantages and disadvantages of the three modelling approaches are discussed, as are the implications of the results for the recommended use of the three types of models in practical management.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edselp&AN=S0304380004003254&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

An SH model based nomogram was built after a variable selection process. The validation of the nomogram was conducted by discrimination and calibration with 1,000 bootstraps. Results: We included 8,983 CRC patients who had KRAS testing. SH model found that KRAS mutant patients had worse CSS than KRAS wild type patients in overall cohort (HR = 1.10 (95% CI [1.04-1.17]), p < 0.05), and in subgroups that comprised stage III CRC (HR = 1.28 (95% CI [1.09-1.49]), p < 0.05) and stage IV CRC (HR = 1.14 (95% CI [1.06-1.23]), p < 0.05), left side colon cancer (HR = 1.28 (95% CI [1.15-1.42]), p < 0.05) and rectal cancer (HR = 1.23 (95% CI [1.07-1.43]), p < 0.05). We built the SH model based nomogram, which showed good accuracy by internal validation of discrimination and calibration. Calibration curves represented good agreement between the nomogram predicted CRC caused death and actual observed CRC caused death. The time dependent area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was over 0.75 for the nomogram. Conclusion: This is the first population based competing risk study on the association between KRAS mutation status and the CRC prognosis. The mutation of KRAS indicated a poor prognosis of CRC patients. The current competing risk nomogram would help physicians to predict cancer specific death of CRC patients who had KRAS testing. © 2020 Dai et al.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=mnh&AN=32547859&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

For those species to avoid regional extinction in fragmented landscapes, they must undergo some kind of metapopulation dynamics so that local extinctions are countered by recolonisation. The importance of spatial dynamics for regional survival means that research into metapopulation dynamics is essential. In this review I explore the approaches taken to examine metapopulation dynamics, highlight the analytical methods used to get the most information out of field data, and discover some of the major research gaps. Statistical models, including Hanski’s INCIDENCE FUNCTION model (IFM) are frequently applied to presence–absence data, an approach that is often strengthened using long-term data sets that document extinctions and colonisations. Recent developments are making the IFM more biologically realistic and expanding the range of situations for which the model is relevant. Although accurate predictions using the IFM seem unlikely, it may be useful for ranking management decisions. A key weakness of presence–absence modelling is that the mechanisms underlying spatial dynamics remain inferential, so combining modelling approaches with detailed demographic research is warranted. For species where very large data sets cannot be obtained to facilitate statistical modelling, a demographic approach alone or with stochastic modelling may be the only viable research angle to take. Dispersal is a central process in metapopulation dynamics. Research combining mark–recapture or telemetry methods with model-selection procedures demonstrate that dispersal is frequently oversimplified in conceptual and statistical metapopulation models. Dispersal models like the island model that underlies classic metapopulation theory do not approximate the behaviour of real species in fragmented landscapes. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain if additional biological realism will improve predictions of statistical metapopulation models. Genetic methods can give better estimates of dispersal than direct methods and take less effort, so they should be routinely explored alongside direct ecological methods. Recent development of metacommunity theory (communities connected by dispersal) emphasises a range of mechanisms that complement metapopulation theory. Taking both theories into account will enhance interpretation of field data. The extent of metapopulation dynamics in human modified landscapes remains uncertain, but we have a powerful array of field and analytical approaches for reducing this knowledge gap. The most informative way forward requires that many species are studied in the same fragmented landscape by applying a selection of approaches that reveal complementary aspects of spatial dynamics. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Lorsque la perte et la fragmentation des habitats sont importantes, il est vraisemblable que plusieurs des espèces indigènes aient des niveaux réduits de dispersion entre leurs populations subsistantes. Pour que ces populations évitent l’extinction régionale dans les paysages fragmentés, il leur faut de quelque façon adopter une dynamique de métapopulation afin que les extinctions locales soient compensées par des recolonisations. L’importance de la dynamique spatiale pour la survie régionale rend indispensable l’étude de la dynamique des métapopulations. La présente rétrospective examine les approches retenues pour l’examen de la dynamique des métapopulations, souligne les méthodes analytiques utilisées pour extraire le maximum d’information des données de terrain et identifie quelques-unes des lacunes principales dans la recherche. On utilise fréquemment des modèles statistiques, dont le modèle de FONCTION d’INCIDENCE (IFM) de Hanski, avec des données de présence–absence, une méthode souvent étayée par l’utilisation d’ensembles de données à long terme qui renseignent sur les extinctions et les colonisations. Des développements récents sont en train de rendre l’IFM plus réaliste biologiquement et élargissent la gamme de situations dans lesquelles le modèle peut s’appliquer. Bien qu’il soit peu vraisemblable de pouvoir faire des prédictions précises à l’aide de l’IFM, le modèle peut s’avérer utile pour mettre en ordre des décisions de gestion. Une faiblesse importante de la modélisation basée sur la présence–absence est que les mécanismes sous-jacents de la dynamique spatiale sont connus par déduction; il est donc nécessaire de combiner les approches de modélisation avec de la recherche démographique détaillée. Chez les espèces pour lesquelles il n’est pas possible d’obtenir de grands ensembles de données pour faciliter la modélisation statistique, l’approche démographique seule ou combinée à la modélisation stochastique peut s’avérer être la seule avenue de recherche disponible. La dispersion est un mécanisme central de la dynamique des métapopulations. Des travaux qui allient les méthodes de marquage–recapture ou de télémétrie et les méthodes de sélection de modèles démontrent que la dispersion est fréquemment sursimplifiée dans les modèles conceptuels et statistiques de métapopulations. Les modèles de dispersion, comme le modèle de biogéographie des îles qui sous-tend la théorie classique des métapopulations, ne s’accordent pas au comportement des vraies espèces dans les paysages fragmentés. Il est néanmoins pas sûr qu’un meilleur réalisme biologique puisse améliorer les prédictions des modèles statistiques de métapopulations. Les méthodes génétiques peuvent fournir de meilleures estimations de la dispersion que les méthodes directes et demandent moins d’effort; il y aurait donc lieu de les considérer en même temps que les méthodes écologiques directes dans les recherches courantes. Des progrès récents dans la théorie des métacommunautés (des communautés réunies par la dispersion) mettent en lumière une gamme de mécanismes qui viennent compléter la théorie des métapopulations. En considérant les deux théories, on améliore l’interprétation des données de terrain. La portée de la dynamique des métapopulations dans les paysages modifiés par l’activité humaine reste incertaine, mais il existe un ensemble efficace de méthodologies de terrain et d’analyse qui permettraient de réduire cette lacune dans nos connaissances. La méthode la plus instructive pour progresser consiste en l’étude de plusieurs espèces dans un même paysage fragmenté à l’aide d’un choix de méthodologies qui permettent de mettre en lumière des aspects complémentaires de la dynamique spatiale.

Selection of restoration sites typically involves too many options and too much uncertainty to reach a decision based on existing reserve design methods. The Fender's blue butterfly ( Icaricia icarioides fenderi) survives in small, isolated patches of remnant prairie in Oregon's Willamette Valley—a habitat for which<0.5% of the original remains. Recovery of this species will require considerable habitat restoration. We investigated the potential of biologically based rules of thumb and more complex models to serve as tools in making land acquisitions. Based on Fender's blue dispersal behavior and demography, we have estimated that restored patches should be<1 km from existing habitat and at least 2 ha. We compared these rules to the results of two modeling approaches: an incidence function model and a spatially explicit simulation of demography and dispersal behavior. Not surprisingly, the simple rules and complex models all conclude that large (>2 ha) connected (<1 km) patches have the highest restoration value. The dispersal model, however, suggests that small, connected patches have more restoration value than large, isolated patches, whereas the incidence function model suggests that size and connectivity are equally important. These differences stem from model assumptions. We used incidence functions to predict long-term, stochastic, steady-state conditions and dispersal simulations to predict short-term (25-year) colonization dynamics. To apply our results in the context of selecting restoration sites on the ground, we recommend selecting nearby sites when short-term colonization dynamics are expected to be an important aspect of a species' biology.

Típicamente, la selección de sitios de restauración implica demasiadas opciones y demasiada incertidumbre para tomar una decisión con base en los métodos de diseño de reservas existentes. La mariposa azul de Fender (Icaricia icarioides fenderi) sobrevive en fragmentos de pradera pequeños y aislados en el Valle Willamette, Oregon –donde solo permanece 0.5% del hábitat original. La recuperación de esta especie requerirá de considerable restauración de hábitat. Investigamos el uso potencial de principios con bases biológicas y de modelos más complejos como herramientas para la adquisición de tierras. Con base en el comportamiento de dispersión y la demografía de mariposa de Fender, hemos estimado que los fragmentos restaurados deben estar < 1 km de hábitat existente y tener una superficie de por lo menos 2 ha. Comparamos estos principios con los resultados de dos modelos: una función de incidencia y una simulación espacialmente explícita de la demografía y del comportamiento de dispersión. No fue sorpresa que tanto los principios sencillos como los modelos complejos concluyen que los parches extensos (> 2 ha), conectados (< 1 km) tienen el valor de restauración más elevado. Sin embargo, el modelo de dispersión sugiere que los parches pequeños y conectados tienen mayor valor de restauración que parches extensos y aislados, mientras que el modelo de función de incidencia sugiere que la extensión y la conectividad son igualmente importantes. Estas diferencias se originan en las suposiciones de los modelos. Utilizamos las funciones de incidencia para predecir condiciones estables estocásticas a largo plazo y las simulaciones de dispersión para predecir dinámicas de colonización a corto plazo (25 años). Para aplicar nuestros resultados en el contexto de la selección de sitios de restauración en el campo, recomendamos la selección de sitios cercanos cuando se espera que la dinámica de colonización a corto plazo sea un aspecto importante de la biología de la especie.

Particular indicators are required to assess the impacts of habitat fragmentation on landscape connectivity and biodiversity value. This paper recognises that connectivity is best defined by the interaction between species and the landscape in which they occur, and proposes a functional approach to assess connectivity. The approach utilises an incidence function model (IFM) as a spatially explicit method to assess potential species-level connectivity. The standard IFM connectivity measure is modified to account for the influence of the surrounding landscape matrix on edge impacts (through a weighted internal edge buffer) and ecological isolation (through an assessment of least-cost distance to account for landscape permeability). It has been recognised that such patch-based connectivity measures can provide misleading results when used to examine change, as they only focus on between patch movements. As a result, a modified hybrid IFM, based on a combination of patch and cell-based approaches, is developed to account for both within (intra) and between (inter) patch connectivity. The resulting probability of functional connectivity (PFC) indicator was evaluated, alongside a patch-based connectivity measure, through the application to four model landscapes based on changes (2 negative and 2 positive) to a control landscape. The four model landscapes illustrate the impact of landscape change on habitat area, edge impacts and matrix permeability. The proposed PFC indicator successfully discriminated between the two negative and the two positive changes to the control landscape, whereas, the patch-based connectivity measure detected change successfully within three of the four landscapes. The PFC indicator predicted a decrease in intra and inter-patch connectivity following habitat loss and fragmentation (negative change 1), whereas patch-based connectivity measures indicate an increase in connectivity between fragmented patches. The proposed PFC indicator offers the opportunity to take the necessary species-based perspective to examine functional connectivity, incorporating habitat preference, dispersal probability, edge impacts and ecological isolation/permeability. The urgency to assess changes in connectivity and support conservation policy means that there is little time to wait for more complete data. We believe the proposed approach provides a robust balance between the data required and the biologically meaningful indicator produced.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edselp&AN=S1470160X09001290&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

However, for fragmented landscapes the importance of regional processes, such as seed dispersal among isolated habitat patches, has been controversially debated. Due to the stochasticity and rarity of among-patch dispersal and colonization events, we still lack a quantitative understanding of the consequences of these processes at the landscape-scale. In this study, we used extensive field data from a fragmented, semi-arid landscape in Israel to parameterize a multi-species incidence-function model. This model simulates species occupancy pattern based on patch areas and habitat configuration and explicitly considers the locations and the shapes of habitat patches for the derivation of patch connectivity. We implemented an approximate Bayesian computation approach for parameter inference and uncertainty assessment. We tested which of the three types of regional dynamics - the metacommunity, the mainland-island, or the island communities type - best represents the community dynamics in the study area and applied the simulation model to estimate the extinction debt in the investigated landscape. We found that the regional dynamics in the patch-matrix study landscape is best represented as a system of highly isolated 'island' communities with low rates of propagule exchange among habitat patches and consequently low colonization rates in local communities. Accordingly, the extinction rates in the local communities are the main drivers of community dynamics. Our findings indicate that the landscape carries a significant extinction debt and in model projections 33-60% of all species went extinct within 1000 yr. Our study demonstrates that the combination of dynamic simulation models with field data provides a promising approach for understanding regional community dynamics and for projecting community responses to habitat fragmentation. The approach bears the potential for efficient tests of conservation activities aimed at mitigating future losses of biodiversity.

Disturbances are expected to reduce metapopulation occupancy for species associated with stable habitats, but they may benefit species adapted to transitory habitats by maintaining a dynamic mosaic of successional stages. However, while early-successional species may be favoured by very frequent disturbances resetting successional dynamics, metapopulation occupancy may be highest at interme-diate disturbance levels for species with mid-successional habitat preferences, though this may be conditional on species traits and patch network characteristics. Here we test this ‘intermediate disturbance hypothesis’ applied to metapopulations (MIDH), using stochastic patch occupancy simulation modelling to assess when does intermediate disturbance favour metapopulation occupancy. We focused on 54 virtual species varying in their habitat preferences, dispersal abilities and local extinction and colonization rates. Long-term metapopulation dynamics was estimated in landscapes with different habitat amounts and patch turnover rates (i.e. disturbance frequency).Results:Equilibrium metapopulation occupancy by late-successional species strongly declined with increasing disturbance frequency, while occupancy by early-successional species increased with disturbance frequency at low disturbance levels and tended to level-off thereafter. Occupancy by mid-successional species tended to increase along with disturbance frequency at low disturbance levels and declining thereafter. Irrespective of habitat prefer-ences, occupancy increased with the amount of habitat, and with species dispersal ability and colonisation efficiency.Conclusions:Our study suggests that MIDH is verified only for species associated with mid-successional habitats. These species may be particularly sensitive to land use changes causing either increases or decreases in disturbance frequency. This may be the case, for instance, of species associated with traditional agricultural and pastoral mosaic landscapes, where many species disappear either through intensification or abandonment processes that change disturbance frequency.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsrca&AN=rcaap.10174.28199&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Understanding how species distributions will shift in response to climate change therefore requires techniques that incorporate the combined effects of climate and landscape-scale habitat availability on colonization rates. We use a metapopulation model (Incidence Function Model, IFM) to test effects of fine-scale habitat use on patterns and rates of range expansion by the butterfly Hesperia comma. At its northern range margin in Britain, this species has increased its breadth of microhabitat use because of climate warming, leading to increased colonization rates. We validated the IFM by reconstructing expansions in five habitat networks between 1982 and 2000, before using it to predict metapopulation dynamics over 100 yr, for three scenarios based on observed changes to habitat use. We define the scenarios as “cold-world” (only hot, south-facing 150–250° hillsides are deemed warm enough), “warm-world” in which 100–300° hillsides can be populated, and “hot-world”, where the background climate is warm enough to enable use of all aspects (as increasingly observed). In the simulations, increased habitat availability in the hot-world scenario led to faster range expansion rates, and to long-term differences in distribution size and pattern. Thus, fine-scale changes in the distribution of suitable microclimates led to landscape-scale changes in population size and colonization rate, resulting in coarse-scale changes to the species distribution. Despite use of a wider range of habitats associated with climate change, H. comma is still expected to occupy a small fraction of available habitat in 100 yr. The research shows that metapopulation models represent a potential framework to identify barriers to range expansion, and to predict the effects of environmental change or conservation interventions on species distributions and persistence.

In the absence of direct observation of movement, connectivity or isolation metrics are useful to characterize potential patch-level connectivity. However, multiple metrics exist at varying levels of complexity, and empirical data on species distribution are rarely used to compare performance of metrics. We compared 12 connectivity metrics of varying degrees of complexity to determine which metric best predicts the distribution of prairie dog colonies along an urban gradient of 385 isolated habitat patches in Denver, Colorado, USA. We found that a modified version of the incidence function model including area-weighting of patches and a cost-weighted distance surface best predicted occupancy, where we assumed roads were fairly impermeable to movement, and low-lying drainages provided dispersal corridors. We also found this result to be robust to a range of cost weight parameters. Our results suggest that metrics should incorporate both patch area and the composition of the surrounding matrix. These results provide guidance for improved landscape habitat modeling in fragmented landscapes and can help identify target habitat for conservation and management of prairie dogs in urban systems.

Expansion rates increased with the area, quality and proximity of habitat patches available for colonization, with predicted expansion rates closely matching observed rates in test landscapes.

We analysed the persistence of five model species inhabiting dead wood. By parameterising a metapopulation model (the incidence function model), the model species were all assigned characteristics that makes it likely that they have disappeared from some (20%) forest landscapes with a long history of forest management. In the metapopulation model, a forest stand (5 ha) was regarded as a habitat patch. The amount of habitat in each patch was obtained from models of dead wood dynamics of Norway spruce in central Sweden. Dead wood generated by altered management over the entire landscape was found to be less efficient in reducing extinction risks in comparison to the same amount of dead wood generated by protecting reserves. Because generation of dead wood by altered management is often less expensive than setting aside reserves, it is difficult to determine which conservation measure is most cost-efficient. In a landscape subjected to forestry for the first time, it was better to preserve a few large reserves than many small ones. However, in a managed, highly fragmented forest landscape it was better to set aside many small reserves. The reason for this was that small plots with high habitat quality could be selected, while large reserves originally contained habitats both of high and low quality, and the rate of habitat quality increase was low. A strategy for biodiversity conservation in a managed forest landscape should include information about the history of the landscape, the current amount and spatial distribution of forest habitats, and the potential for rapid restoration of forest habitats, both on managed and unmanaged forest land.

Observed patterns, such as time-series patterns and spatial patterns of presence/absence in habitat patches, contain a great deal of data on scales, site-history, parameters and processes. Use of these data provides criteria for aggregating the biological information in the model, relates the model explicitly to the relevant scales of the system, facilitates the use of helpful techniques of indirect parameter estimation with independent data, and helps detect underlying ecological processes. Additionally, pattern-oriented models produce comparative predictions that can be tested in the field. We developed a step-by-step protocol for pattern-oriented modeling and illustrate the potential of this protocol by discussing three pattern-oriented population models: (1) a population viability analysis for brown bears (Ursus arctos ) in northern Spain using time-series data on females with cubs of the year to adjust unknown model parameters; (2) a savanna model for detecting underlying ecological processes from spatial patterns of tree distribution; and (3) the incidence function model of metapopulation dynamics as an example of process integration and model generalization. We conclude that using the pattern-oriented approach to its full potential will require a major paradigm shift in the strategies of modeling and data collection, and we argue that more emphasis must be placed on observing and documenting relevant patterns in addition to attempts to obtain direct estimates of model parameters.

Patch area was the most significant variable predicting the occurrence of E. aurinia in a habitat patch. The species tended to be found in young rather than old clearcuts, apparently because the vegetation became too high in the latter.

However, managers lack an assessment method that integrates threat abatement and can be used when demographic data are limited. To help meet these needs, we demonstrated an approach for evaluating species status based on habitat configuration data. We applied 3 established persistence measures (patch occupancy, metapopulation capacity, and proportion of population lost) to compare 2 conservation strategies (critical habitat designated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service's Carbonate Habitat Management Strategy) and 2 threat scenarios (maximum limestone mining, removal of all habitat in areas with mining claims; minimum mining, removal of habitat only in areas with existing operations and high-quality ore) against a baseline of existing habitat for 3 federally listed plant species. Protecting all area within the designated critical habitat maintained a similar level (83.9-99.9%) of species persistence as the baseline, whereas maximum mining greatly reduced persistence (0.51-38.4% maintained). The 3 persistence measures provided complementary insights reflecting different aspects of habitat availability (total area, number of patches, patch size, and connectivity). These measures can be used to link recovery criteria developed following the 3 R principles (representation, redundancy, and resilience) to the resulting improvements in species viability. By focusing on amount and distribution of habitat, our method provides a means of assessing the status of data-poor species to inform decision making under the Endangered Species Act.

We report the results of a study that spans 30 generations (years) of the entire natural range of a butterfly race that is endemic to 35 km2 of north Wales, UK. Short-term studies (surveys in single years and dynamics over 4 years) of this system led to the prediction that the regional distribution would be quite stable, and that colonization and extinction dynamics would be relatively unimportant. However, a longer-term study revealed unexpectedly high levels of population turnover (local extinction and colonization), affecting 18 out of the 20 patches that were occupied at any time during the period. Modelling the system (using the 'incidence function model' (IFM) for metapopulations) also showed higher levels of colonization and extinction with increasing duration of the study. The longer-term dynamics observed in this system can be compared, at a metapopulation level, with the increased levels of variation observed with increasing time that have been observed in single populations. Long-term changes may arise from local changes in the environment that make individual patches more or less suitable for the butterfly, or from unusual colonization or extinction events that take metapopulations into alternative states. One implication is that metapopulation and population viability analyses based on studies that cover only a few animal or plant generations may underestimate extinction threats.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edo&AN=ejs2106524&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Colobus occurrence and density in this forest network was significantly linked to the spatial characteristics and quality of habitat patches. The heterogeneous landscape between habitat patches (matrix) was also found to be important, providing additional foraging habitat and connectivity between forest patches. The use of a spatially explicit metapopulation model (the incidence function model) provided a conceptual framework in which to explore future scenarios of habitat change.
