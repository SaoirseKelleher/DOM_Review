In this paper, we study a stochastic patch occupancy model that incorporates variation in quality and connectivity of the habitat patches. Two important assumptions are imposed in our analysis. Firstly, the distance between patches has a special form. This amounts to assuming that migrating individuals follow certain pathways. Secondly, the area of the habitat patches is assumed to scale with the number of patches in the metapopulation. Under these assumptions, a deterministic limit is obtained as the number of patches goes to infinity. Using the deterministic limiting process, a condition for persistence of the metapopulation is derived.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edssjs&AN=edssjs.E8521689&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Here a Bayesian method is presented for estimating parameters of such models from data on patch occupancy in one or more years. Earlier methods were either ad hoc, produced only point estimates, or could only use turnover information. The new method is based on the assumption of quasi-stationarity, which enables it to use not only turnover data, but also snapshot data. Being Bayesian, the method produces reliable information about the uncertainty of the parameters and model-based predictions in the form of posterior distributions. It is computationally demanding, but considerably faster than a recently developed Bayesian method extended beyond turnover data. The method is compared with existing methods (placed in a Bayesian framework) by fitting an extended incidence function model to a data set on a tree frog metapopulation with many missing values and by predicting its viability, mean occupancy, and turnover rate after 100 yr.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.3108011&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

As an example, we apply the model to the Glanville fritillary butterfly ( Melitaea cinxia ) inhabiting a highly fragmented landscape. We derive stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) approximations for the IBMs assuming pure demographic stochasticity, uncorrelated environmental stochasticity, or completely correlated environmental stochasticity in local dynamics. Using realistic parameter values for the Glanville fritillary, we show that the SPOMs mimic the behavior of the IBMs well.

In source-sink systems, similarly, connectivity may be beneficial in terms of effective size, but detrimental in terms of survival, by lowering the reproductive value of source populations. How to reconcile these opposite effects? Here we propose an analytical framework that integrates fixation time (ability to resist genetic drift) and extinction time (ability to resist demographic extinction) into a single index of resistance, measuring the ability of a metapopulation to maintain its demo-genetic integrity.

A problem with SPOMs has been that if the spatial structure of a heterogeneous habitat patch network is taken into account, the computational effort needed to analyze a SPOM grows as a power of 2 n , where n is the number of habitat patches. I propose a computationally feasible approximation method, which approximates the behavior of a heterogeneous SPOM by an “ideal” metapopulation inhabiting a network of identical and equally connected habitat patches. The transformation to the ideal metapopulation is based on weighting the individual patch occupancies by the dynamic values of the habitat patches, which may be calculated from the deterministic mean‐field approximation of the original SPOM. Conceptually, the method resembles the calculation of the effective size of a population in the context of population genetics. I demonstrate how the method may be applied to SPOMs with flexible structural assumptions and with spatially correlated and temporally varying parameter values. I apply the method to a real habitat patch network inhabited by the Glanville fritillary butterfly, illustrating that the metapopulation dynamics of this species are essentially driven by temporal variability in the environmental conditions.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.10.1086.342818&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

In such cases, prioritizing long-vacant patches for restoration is an intuitively appealing strategy for minimizing the effects on endangered species. Metapopulation models grounded in empirical data potentially provide a rigorous framework for developing theoretical “patch vacancy thresholds” (i.e., duration of vacancy required before implementing restoration) and assessing the implications of such criteria for restoration objectives. We develop such a model for spotted owls (Strix occidentalis), which embody the species–ecosystem dilemma given their preference for closed-canopy forests that are also susceptible to severe fire and drought and hence the center of debates about forest restoration intended to reduce fire and drought risk. We leveraged a >20-year territory occupancy dataset to parameterize a Stochastic Patch Occupancy Model (SPOM) to assess relative risk to a metapopulation of owls in California under alternative conservation guidelines, including a range of vacancy thresholds. Territories with greater amounts of owl habitat were more likely to be recolonized and less likely to go extinct. Importantly, the probability of a vacant owl territory becoming recolonized declined as length of vacancy increased; territories vacant for 1 and 10 years had annual recolonization probabilities of 0.34 and 0.06, respectively. Based on our SPOM, projected territory occupancy rates declined as the vacancy threshold decreased and as habitat within territories was impacted by restoration. However, more liberal territory vacancy thresholds were projected to increase the proportion of territories (and thus landscape) that could be restored and that restored conditions could be maintained with repeated treatments. Reintroducing natural disturbance regimes, which eliminated the need for repeated treatments, was projected to reduce risk to owls, particularly with relaxed vacancy thresholds. We provide a simple, yet novel, metapopulation framework for quantifying how alternative conservation guidelines might impact owl occupancy and influence forest restoration guidelines. Similar analyses could facilitate restoration efforts in other systems by more explicitly quantifying tradeoffs between species–ecosystem objectives.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edselp&AN=S000632071731769X&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

However, there are few studies that investigate the interaction between these two threats using empirical data., Here, we investigate interactions between climate change and land-use change in the future distribution of 23 dominant tree species in mainland Spain. We simulated changes up to year 2100 using a climate-dependent Stochastic Patch Occupancy Model, parameterized with colonization and extinction events recorded in 46 596 survey plots., We estimated that the distribution of 17 out of 23 tree species are expanding and hence not at equilibrium with the climate. However, climate change will make the future occupancy of 15 species to be lower than expected if climate, and habitat, remained stable (baseline scenario)., Climate change, when combined with the loss of 20% of the habitat, was estimated to reduce species occupancies (relative to baseline projections) by an average of 23% if habitat loss was spatially clumped, and by 35% if it was scattered. If habitat loss occurred in areas already impacted by human activities, species occupancies would be reduced by 26%. Land-use changes leading to habitat gain (i.e. creation through reforestation) could slightly mitigate the effects of climate change, but a 20% increment in habitat would reduce climate change-driven losses in species occupancies by only ∼3%., Synthesis and applications. The distributions of the most common tree species in mainland Spain are expanding, but climate change threatens to reduce this expansion by ∼18% for 15 of the 23 studied species. Moreover, if the habitat of these species is simultaneously lost, the occupancies of all of them will be reduced further, with variation depending on the spatial pattern of the lost habitats. However, we did not detect synergies between climate change and habitat loss. The combined effect (with 20% habitat loss) was 5-13% less than what it would be if the effects were additive. Importantly, reforestation could partially offset the negative effects of climate change, but complete mitigation would require an increase in forested land of ∼80%, and the prioritization of territories that are less impacted by human activities.

Models are needed for understanding and predicting metapopulation dynamics in changing landscapes. One particularly important question is what is the effect of habitat loss to the persistence of a metapopulation. A class of metapopulation models that have been successfully used in practical applications are called stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs), which model the presence/absence of the species on habitat patches as a Markov chain. The presence–absence assumption makes the model relatively parameter sparse, facilitates empirical data collection, and enables rigorous parameter estimation. This study reviews theory of SPOMs and describes a computational tool, called SPOMSIM, which allows one to simulate SPOMs and estimate parameters for them. SPOMSIM offers a range of choices for submodels; alternatives are provided for the functional forms of local extinction, the dispersal kernel, computation of connectivity, the colonization function, the implementation of the rescue effect and the implementation of regional stochasticity. SPOMSIM includes also, among other things, a utility based on hierarchical clustering for the analysis of the structure of a patch network, a reserve network optimization algorithm, and a patch system editor which makes it possible to investigate the consequences of changes in landscape structure. Potential uses for SPOMSIM include scientific metapopulation studies, teaching and conservation management.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edselp&AN=S0304380004002790&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Here we compare the parameter estimates, model fits, and predictive abilities of two models of metapopulation dynamics: a detailed individual-based model (IBM) and a population-based stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) derived from the IBM. The two models were fitted to a 17-year time series of data for the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) inhabiting a network of 72 small meadows. The data consisted of biannual counts of larval groups (IBM) and the annual presence or absence of local populations (SPOM). The models were fitted using a Bayesian state-space approach with a hierarchical random effect structure to account for observational, demographic, and environmental stochasticities. The detection probability of larval groups (IBM) and the probability of false zeros of local populations (SPOM) in the observation models were simultaneously estimated from the timeseries data and independent control data. Prior distributions for dispersal parameters were obtained from a separate analysis of mark-recapture data. Both models fitted the data about equally, but the results were more precise for the IBM than for the SPOM. The two models yielded similar estimates for a random effect parameter describing habitat quality in each patch, which were correlated with independent empirical measures of habitat quality. The modeling results showed that variation in habitat quality influenced patch occupancy more through the effects on movement behavior at patch edges than on carrying capacity, whereas the latter influenced the mean population size in occupied patches. The IBM and the SPOM explained 63% and 45%, respectively, of the observed variation in the fraction of occupied habitat area among 75 independent patch networks not used in parameter estimation. We conclude that, while carefully constructed, detailed models can have better predictive ability than simple models, this advantage comes with the cost of greatly increased data requirements and computational challenges. Our results illustrate how complex models can be helpful in facilitating the construction of effective simpler models.

Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) research uses a multidisciplinary approach to identify the key actors, processes, and feedbacks that drive metapopulation and landscape dynamics. We describe a framework for modeling metapopulations in CHANS that integrates ecological and social data by coupling stochastic patch occupancy models of metapopulation dynamics with agent‐based models of land‐use change. We then apply this framework to metapopulations of the threatened black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) and widespread Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) that inhabit patchy, irrigation‐fed wetlands in the rangelands of the California Sierra Nevada foothills. We collected data from five diverse sources (rail occupancy surveys, land‐use change mapping, a survey of landowner decision making, climate and reservoir databases, and mosquito trapping and West Nile virus testing) and integrated them into an agent‐based stochastic patch occupancy model. We used the model to (1) quantify the drivers of metapopulation dynamics, and the potential interactions and feedbacks among them; (2) test predictions of the behavior of metapopulations in dynamic working landscapes; and (3) evaluate the impact of three policy options on metapopulation persistence (irrigation district water cutbacks during drought, incentives for landowners to create wetlands, and incentives for landowners to protect wetlands). Complex metapopulation dynamics emerged when landscapes functioned as CHANS, highlighting the importance of integrating human activities and other ecological processes into metapopulation models. Rail metapopulations were strongly top‐down regulated by precipitation, and the black rail's decade‐long decline was caused by the combination of West Nile virus and drought. Theoretical predictions of the two metapopulations' responses to dynamic landscapes and incentive programs were complicated by heterogeneity in patch quality and CHANS couplings, respectively. Irrigation cutbacks during drought posed a serious extinction risk that neither incentive policy effectively ameliorated.

Typically this endeavor is facilitated either by models from classic metapopu-lation theory focused on spatially explicit, dispersal-driven colonization-extinction dynamics and generally assuming perfect detection, or by more recent hierarchical site occupancy models that account for imperfect detection but rarely include spatial effects, such as dispersal, explicitly. Neither approach explicitly considers local demographics in a way that can be used for future projections. However, despite being arguably of equal importance, dispersal and connectivity, local demography, and imperfect detection are rarely modeled explicitly and simultaneously. Understanding the spatiotemporal occurrence patterns of spatially structured populations and making biologically realistic long-term predictions of persistence would benefit from the simultaneous treatment of space, demography, and detectability. We integrated these key ideas in a tractable and intuitive way to develop a demographic and spatially realistic patch occupancy model that incorporates components of dispersal, local demographic stage-structure, and detectability. By explicitly relating stage-specific abundances to measurable patch properties, biologically realistic projections of long-term metapopulation dynamics could be made. We applied our model to data from a naturally fragmented population of water voles Arvícola amphibius to describe observed patch occupancy dynamics and to investigate long-term persistence under scenarios of elevated stage-specific local extinction. Accounting for biases induced by imperfect detection, we were able to estimate: stable, and higher than observed metapopulation occupancy; high rates of patch turnover and stage-specific colonization and extinction rates (juvenile and adult, respectively); and juvenile dispersal distances (average 2.10 km). We found that metapopulation persistence in the presence of elevated extinction risk differed depending on which life stage was exposed, and was more sensitive to elevated juvenile rather than adult extinction risk. Predictions of persistence when dynamics are stage-specific suggest that metapopulations may be more resilient to changes in the environment than predicted when relationships are based on patch size approximations rather than population sizes. Our approach allows explicit consideration of local dynamics and dispersal in spatially structured and stage-structured populations, provides a more detailed mechanistic understanding of metapopulation functioning, and can be used to investigate future extinction risk under biologically meaningful scenarios.

One factor responsible for this drastic change in prairie-dog population structure is plague (caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis). We fit stochastic patch occupancy models to 20 years of prairie-dog colony occupancy data from two discrete metapopulations (west and east) in the Pawnee National Grassland in Colorado, USA, that differ in connectivity among suitable habitat patches. We conducted model selection between two hypothesized modes of plague movement: independent of prairie-dog dispersal (colony-area) vs. plague movement consistent with prairie-dog dispersal (connectivity to extinct colonies). The best model, which fit the data well (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.94 west area; 0.79 east area), revealed that over time the proportion of extant colonies was better explained by colony size than by connectivity to extinct (plagued) colonies. The idea that prairie dogs are not likely to be the main vector that spreads Y. pestis across the landscape is supported by the observation that colony extinctions are primarily caused by plague, prairie-dog dispersal is short range, and connectivity to extinct colonies was not selected as a factor in the models. We also conducted simulations with the best model to examine long-term patterns of colony occupancy and persistence of prairie-dog metapopulations. In the case where the metapopulations persist, our model predicted that the western metapopulation would have a colony occupancy rate approximately 2.5 times higher than that of the eastern metapopulation (~50% occupied colonies vs. 20%) in 50 years, but that the western metapopulation has ~80% chance of extinction in 100 years while the eastern metapopulation has a less than 25% chance. Extinction probability of individual colonies depended on the frequency with which colonies of the same size class occurred in the metapopulation. Thus, the long-term persistence of prairie-dog metapopulations depended on specific details of the metapopulation.

Although the contributions of stage structure, spatially correlated processes, and the rescue effect to metapopulation dynamics have been investigated in isolation, there is no empirical demonstration of all of these processes shaping dynamics in a single system. Dispersal and settlement differ according to the life stage involved; therefore, stage-specific population size may outperform total population size when predicting colonization-extinction dynamics. Synchrony in patch dynamics can lead to accelerated metapopulation extinction, although empirical evidence of the interplay between correlated colonization events and correlated extinctions is lacking. Likewise, few empirical examples exist that provide compelling evidence of migration acting to reduce extinction risk (the rescue effect). We parameterized a hierarchy of metapopulation models to investigate these predictions using a seven-year study of a naturally occurring water vole (Arvícola amphibius) metapopulation. Specifically, we demonstrated the importance of local stage structure in predicting both colonization and extinction events using juvenile and adult population sizes, respectively. Using a novel approach for quantifying correlation in extinction events, we compared the scale of synchrony in colonization and extinction. Strikingly, the scale of dispersal acting to synchronize colonization was an order of magnitude larger than that of correlated extinctions (halving distance of the effect; 12.40 km and 0.89 km, respectively). Additionally, we found compelling evidence for the existence of a nontrivial rescue effect. Here we provide a novel empirical demonstration of a variety of metapopulation processes operating at multiple spatial scales, further emphasizing the need to consider stage structure and local synchrony in the dynamics of spatially dependent, stage-structured (meta) populations.

However, metapopulation studies rarely connect abundance and detectability. We propose a framework for using abundance-based estimates of detectability in the analysis of a spatially-explicit stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM). We illustrate our approach with the example of Tenebrio opacus, a beetle inhabiting hollows in old trees, and have based it on a 6-year monitoring programme of adult beetles in an area harbouring a high density of old oaks. We validated our abundance-based methodology by showing that the estimates of detectability were positively and significantly correlated with those obtained from presence/absence data (Pearson r = 0.54, p < 2E-16) in our study system. We further showed that the height of the hollow on the tree and the area of its entrance hole, the living status and girth of the host tree, and the time of survey significantly affected the detectability of beetle populations. Median detectability was 51% for one survey. The SPOM analysis revealed a high but heterogeneous extinction risk among trees, suggesting a metapopulation dynamics between the ""classic"" and ""mainland-island"" paradigms. However, it also indicated unexplained beetle colonization of trees in our study, despite the fact that we included limited detectability in our estimation procedure. This may have been due to the cryptic larval stage of T. opacus and may thus invalidate the use of a classic SPOM in our study system.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=mnh&AN=30066028&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Bayesian PVAs allow uncertainty in the parameters of the underlying population model to be easily propagated through to the predictions. We developed a Bayesian stochastic patch occupancy model ( SPOM) and used this model to assess the viability of a metapopulation of the growling grass frog ( Litoria raniformis) under different urbanization scenarios. Location Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Methods We fitted a Bayesian model that accounted for imperfect detection to a multiseason occupancy dataset for L. raniformis collected across northern Melbourne. The probability of extinction was modelled as a function of effective wetland area, aquatic vegetation cover and connectivity, using logistic regression. The probability of colonization was modelled as a function of connectivity alone. We then simulated the dynamics of a metapopulation of L. raniformis subject to differing levels of urbanization and compensatory wetland creation. Uncertainty was propagated by conducting simulations for 5000 estimates of the parameters of the models for extinction and colonization. Results There was considerable uncertainty in both the probability of quasi-extinction and the minimum number of occupied wetlands under most urbanization scenarios. Uncertainty around the change in quasi-extinction risk and minimum metapopulation size increased with increasing habitat loss. For our focal metapopulation, the analysis revealed that significant investment in new wetlands may be required to offset the impacts of urbanization. Main conclusions Bayesian approaches to PVA allow parametric uncertainty to be propagated and considered in management decisions. They also provide means of identifying parameters that represent critical uncertainties, and, through the use of informative priors, can easily assimilate new data to reduce parametric uncertainty. These advantages, and the ready availability of software to run Bayesian analyses, will ensure that Bayesian approaches are used increasingly for PVAs.

Here, we investigate how group dispersal and Allee effects shape metapopulation dynamics identifying conditions in which group dispersal can be an advantage over independent dispersal. We approach this question by building and analysing a Markovian random walk for metapopulation dynamics including group dispersal and Allee effect. This Markovian random walk is analogous to the discrete-time Stochastic Patch Occupancy Model (SPOM). We find that intermediate group sizes may lead to larger and more sustainable metapopulations in the presence of an Allee effect. Hence, understanding how group size variation and realized (meta)population dynamics are linked offers an exciting future venue for research that is expected to yield key insights into the ecology and evolution of populations occupying spatially structured environments.

In some cases, the presence of environmental pathogen reservoirs on high-quality habitat may lead to the creation of ecological traps, wherein host individuals preferentially colonize high-quality habitat, but are then exposed to increased infection risk and disease-induced mortality. We explored this possibility through the development of a stochastic patch occupancy model, where we varied the pathogen's virulence, transmission rate and environmental persistence as well as the distribution of habitat quality in the host metapopulation. This model suggests that for pathogens with intermediate levels of spread, high-quality habitat can serve as an ecological trap, and can be detrimental to host persistence relative to low-quality habitat. This inversion of the relative roles of high- and low-quality habitat highlights the importance of considering the interaction between spatial structure and pathogen transmission when managing wildlife populations exposed to an environmentally persistent pathogen.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=mnh&AN=27069672&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Here we suggest a general classification of the dynamics that allows the identification, in a model-independent manner, of the regimes where coherence effects are strong. We also present a new technique, based on patch occupancy (presence/absence) data, for identifying the role of spatial coherence in the stabilization of a metapopulation. If the chance of a local extinction grows with the connectivity, this implies that spatial synchronization is too strong and that regional-scale extinction becomes possible. When this scenario occurs, a decrease in the movement of individuals (habitat fragmentation, reduced dispersal rates) has a positive effect on the sustainability of the spatially distributed population. The results of individual based simulations of a spatially structured population are analyzed with SPOM and the regime where the two-state approximation fails is identified.

The water vole, Arvicola amphibius, is one such species. Water voles have recently undergone a significant decline in the UK, as a result of habitat loss and predation from the introduced American mink, Neovison vison. Large reed bed and grazing marsh sites can provide refuge habitats for water voles from mink predation, in which case populations within these sites could sustain metapopulations in the surrounding landscape where conditions are less favourable. We carried out a study using a stochastic patch occupancy model to determine the long term viability of water vole metapopulations in the wider landscape around a series of extensive reed bed and grazing marsh sites designated as National Key Sites for water voles. The results of our model simulations show that a large protected core site, or mainland, is essential in maintaining the long term viability of these systems. Our results also show how these metapopulations could be enhanced by increasing patch numbers through habitat creation and/or restoration and suggest what the minimum effective size of created or restored patches should be. The study shows how population modelling can provide insight into some effective practical ways of enhancing the viability of water vole metapopulations at the landscape scale. Furthermore it demonstrates that extensive wetlands are an appropriate focus for water vole conservation measures.

First, the patch occupancy data must be collected. Second, the SPOM must be formulated. Third, given the mathematical representation of the SPOM that results from the second step, the model must be parameterized using the dataset at hand and/or independent information about these parameters. Fourth, predictions can be made with the model by considering different scenarios. The reliability of these predictions must be assessed through uncertainty analysis. This chapter assumes the dataset and the SPOM to be given and concentrates on the third part by reviewing the various methods that have been developed to parameterize SPOMs using snapshot and/or turnover data. It then focuses on some of the problems still remaining, and their consequences for the fourth part, making model predictions for real metapopulations. The chapter shows that the model predictions are useful in determining the best conservation strategies for the real metapopulation. For this, it compares the distribution pattern in 2002 with the distribution pattern predicted from the model calibrated with data from 1981 to 1983 and 1986. The chapter ends with a discussion on the four parts in the application of SPOMs and an overview of the insights gained by the application of SPOMs.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edselp&AN=B9780123234483500076&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Dispersal in the model is directed toward local (nearby) suitable habitat patches, following the observed seed-caching behavior of the European Jay. Model parameters were estimated using Bayesian methods and survey data from 12047 plots. Model simulations were conducted to explore the importance of different dispersal modes (local directed, global directed, local random, global random). The SPOM with local directed dispersal gave a much better fit to the data and reproduced observed regional abundance, abundance-environment correlations, and spatial autocorrelation in abundance for all three species. Model simulations suggest that jay-mediated directed dispersal increases regional abundance and alters species-environment correlations. Local dispersal is estimated to reduce regional abundances, amplify species-environment correlations, and amplify spatial autocorrelation. Parameter estimates and model simulations reveal important species-specific differences in sensitivity to environmental perturbations and dispersal mode. The dominant species Q. ilex is estimated to be highly fecund, but on the edge of its climatic tolerance. Therefore Q. ilex gains little from directed dispersal, suffers little from local dispersal, and is relatively insensitive to changes in habitat cover or disturbance rate; but Q. ilex is highly sensitive to altered drought length. In contrast, the rarest species, Q. coccifera, is well adapted to the climate and soils but has low fecundity; thus, it is highly sensitive to changes in dispersal, habitat cover, and disturbance but insensitive to altered drought length. Finally, Q. faginea is estimated to be both at the edge of its climatic tolerance and to have low fecundity, making it sensitive to all perturbations. Apparently, co-occurring species can exhibit very different interactions among dispersal, environmental characteristics, and physiological tolerances, calling for increased attention to species-specific dynamics in determining regional vegetation responses to anthropogenic perturbations.

However, the benefits of high-quality habitat may be modulated by the presence of an environmentally persistent pathogen. In some cases, the presence of environmental pathogen reservoirs on high-quality habitat may lead to the creation of ecological traps, wherein host individuals preferentially colonize high-quality habitat, but are then exposed to increased infection risk and disease-induced mortality. We explored this possibility through the development of a stochastic patch occupancy model, where we varied the pathogen’s virulence, transmission rate and environmental persistence as well as the distribution of habitat quality in the host metapopulation. This model suggests that for pathogens with intermediate levels of spread, high-quality habitat can serve as an ecological trap, and can be detrimental to host persistence relative to low-quality habitat. This inversion of the relative roles of high- and low-quality habitat highlights the importance of considering the interaction between spatial structure and pathogen transmission when managing wildlife populations exposed to an environmentally persistent pathogen.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsdoj&AN=edsdoj.3493a647097f457eb0c91f75201465da&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

To date, the effect of group dispersal on metapopulation dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we investigate how group dispersal and Allee effects shape metapopulation dynamics identifying conditions in which group dispersal can be an advantage over independent dispersal. We approach this question by building and analysing a Markovian random walk for metapopulation dynamics including group dispersal and Allee effect. This Markovian random walk is analogous to the discrete-time Stochastic Patch Occupancy Model (SPOM). We find that intermediate group sizes may lead to larger and more sustainable metapopulations in the presence of an Allee effect. Hence, understanding how group size variation and realized (meta)population dynamics are linked offers an exciting future venue for research that is expected to yield key insights into the ecology and evolution of populations occupying spatially structured environments.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.44685831&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

A large proportion of the world's biodiversity is reportedly threatened by habitat loss and climate change. However, there are few studies that investigate the interaction between these two threats using empirical data. 2. Here, we investigate interactions between climate change and land-use change in the future distribution of 23 dominant tree species in mainland Spain. We simulated changes up to year 2100 using a climate-dependent Stochastic Patch Occupancy Model, parameterized with colonization and extinction events recorded in 46 596 survey plots. 3. We estimated that the distribution of 17 out of 23 tree species are expanding and hence not at equilibrium with the climate. However, climate change will make the future occupancy of 15 species to be lower than expected if climate, and habitat, remained stable (baseline scenario). 4. Climate change, when combined with the loss of 20% of the habitat, was estimated to reduce species occupancies (relative to baseline projections) by an average of 23% if habitat loss was spatially clumped, and by 35% if it was scattered. If habitat loss occurred in areas already impacted by human activities, species occupancies would be reduced by 26%. Landuse changes leading to habitat gain (i.e. creation through reforestation) could slightly mitigate the effects of climate change, but a 20% increment in habitat would reduce climate changedriven losses in species occupancies by only ~ 3 %. 5. Synthesis and applications. The distributions of the most common tree species in mainland Spain are expanding, but climate change threatens to reduce this expansion by ~ 18% for 15 of the 23 studied species. Moreover, if the habitat of these species is simultaneously lost, the occupancies of all of them will be reduced further, with variation depending on the spatial pattern of the lost habitats. However, we did not detect synergies between climate change and habitat loss. The combined effect (with 20% habitat loss) was 5-13% less than what it would be if the effects were additive. Importantly, reforestation could partially offset the negative effects of climate change, but complete mitigation would require an increase in forested land of ~ 80%, and the prioritization of territories that are less impacted by human activities.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.43869262&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Bayesian PVAs allow uncertainty in the parameters of the underlying population model to be easily propagated through to the predictions. We developed a Bayesian stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) and used this model to assess the viability of a metapopulation of the growling grass frog (Litoria raniformis) under different urbanization scenarios. Location: Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Methods: We fitted a Bayesian model that accounted for imperfect detection to a multiseason occupancy dataset for L. raniformis collected across northern Melbourne. The probability of extinction was modelled as a function of effective wetland area, aquatic vegetation cover and connectivity, using logistic regression. The probability of colonization was modelled as a function of connectivity alone. We then simulated the dynamics of a metapopulation of L. raniformis subject to differing levels of urbanization and compensatory wetland creation. Uncertainty was propagated by conducting simulations for 5000 estimates of the parameters of the models for extinction and colonization. Results: There was considerable uncertainty in both the probability of quasi-extinction and the minimum number of occupied wetlands under most urbanization scenarios. Uncertainty around the change in quasi-extinction risk and minimum metapopulation size increased with increasing habitat loss. For our focal metapopulation, the analysis revealed that significant investment in new wetlands may be required to offset the impacts of urbanization. Main conclusions: Bayesian approaches to PVA allow parametric uncertainty to be propagated and considered in management decisions. They also provide means of identifying parameters that represent critical uncertainties, and, through the use of informative priors, can easily assimilate new data to reduce parametric uncertainty. These advantages, and the ready availability of software to run Bayesian analyses, will ensure that Bayesian approaches are used increasingly for PVAs.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.23479777&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

When this effect is significant, the use of inference techniques based on the stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) may be inadequate, since SPOMs assume that each habitat patch is either occupied or empty, thereby neglecting the intra-patch dynamics. Here we suggest a general classification of the dynamics that allows the identification, in a model-independent manner, of the regimes where coherence effects are strong. We also present a new technique, based on patch occupancy (presence/absence) data, for identifying the role of spatial coherence in the stabilization of a metapopulation. If the chance of a local extinction grows with the connectivity, this implies that spatial synchronization is too strong and that regional-scale extinction becomes possible. When this scenario occurs, a decrease in the movement of individuals (habitat fragmentation, reduced dispersal rates) has a positive effect on the sustainability of the spatially distributed population. The results of individual based simulations of a spatially structured population are analyzed with SPOM and the regime where the two-state approximation fails is identified.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.41489286&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Here we compare the parameter estimates, model fits, and predictive abilities of two models of metapopulation dynamics: a detailed individual-based model (IBM) and a population-based stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) derived from the IBM. The two models were fitted to a 17-year time series of data for the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) inhabiting a network of 72 small meadows. The data consisted of biannual counts of larval groups (IBM) and the annual presence or absence of local populations (SPOM). The models were fitted using a Bayesian state-space approach with a hierarchical random effect structure to account for observational, demographic, and environmental stochasticities. The detection probability of larval groups (IBM) and the probability of false zeros of local populations (SPOM) in the observation models were simultaneously estimated from the time-series data and independent control data. Prior distributions for dispersal parameters were obtained from a separate analysis of mark—recapture data. Both models fitted the data about equally, but the results were more precise for the IBM than for the SPOM. The two models yielded similar estimates for a random effect parameter describing habitat quality in each patch, which were correlated with independent empirical measures of habitat quality. The modeling results showed that variation in habitat quality influenced patch occupancy more through the effects on movement behavior at patch edges than on carrying capacity, whereas the latter influenced the mean population size in occupied patches. The IBM and the SPOM explained 63% and 45%, respectively, of the observed variation in the fraction of occupied habitat area among 75 independent patch networks not used in parameter estimation. We conclude that, while carefully constructed, detailed models can have better predictive ability than simple models, this advantage comes with the cost of greatly increased data requirements and computational challenges. Our results illustrate how complex models can be helpful in facilitating the construction of effective simpler models.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.23208475&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

It has been therefore proposed to classify forest plant species according to their affinity for ancient or recent patches. In this contribution, we aimed at providing a dynamical perspective on this static concept of ancient/recent forest species. We developed an inference method to estimate the metapopulation dynamics of forest plants based on landscape history and static (and incomplete) biodiversity data accounting for false absence records. We assessed the power of this novel inference method using simulated metapopulation and landscape dynamics. We finally applied this method to occupancy data of 174 and 121 forest species in two networks of 9208 and 9201 forest patches respectively. These patch networks are located in two French regions, with corresponding landscape historical data based on two forest maps conceived in 1840 and 2000. Our analyses revealed that i) the inference method enables to satisfactorily infer three parameters of the metapopulation model: the rates of colonization, extinction and decay of colonization with distance; ii) this three parameter metapopulation model is sufficient to reproduce the occurrence spatial structure of 72% and 61% of the investigated species in the two regions; iii) forest plant species are distributed along a spectrum of turn-over speed, in which small (large) colonization capacity are associated with small (large) propensity to extinction; iv) species position along this spectrum can be partially predicted from plant functional traits; and v) species metapopulation dynamics are driven by the interaction between landscape and species intrinsic properties, suggesting that ancient/recent forest species lists are unlikely to be easily extrapolated to novel landscapes.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=agr&AN=IND605847826&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"
