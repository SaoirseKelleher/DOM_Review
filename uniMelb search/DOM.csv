It is imperative to reliably identify factors that limit connectivity across heterogeneous, fragmented landscapes. Viewing connectivity as the persistence of movement in space from source to destination—along potential corridors simulated from correlated random walks—we adapt the dynamic occupancy modeling framework to present an approach to reliably quantify connectivity. This approach allowed us to estimate the probability of spatial persistence of movement along potential corridors, while accounting for imperfect detection of animal use of the matrix. We use simulations to test our model, and data from sign surveys of Asian elephant Elephas maximus space use in Garo Hills, Northeast India, as a practical application of the method. Distance to forests and ruggedness predominantly shaped elephant connectivity patterns. Negative effects of distance to forests were intensified at the onset of dispersal, and in the more disturbed part of our landscape. We mapped locations critical to maintaining connectivity in our study landscape. We demonstrate that the widely used occupancy modeling approach, when combined with appropriate field data collection, permits explicit assessment of matrix impacts on connectivity while accounting for imperfect detection of animal movement. In so doing, we highlight the value of the approach in enabling inference on where animals move, as well as why. Obtaining a reliable understanding of factors shaping connectivity is central to understanding and predicting species responses to environmental change, thereby facilitating effective long-term conservation in fragmented landscapes. @@@@Highlights •Connectivity is a priority consideration in landscape-scale conservation programs.•We quantify connectivity and its drivers through an adaptation of occupancy models.•We use data on elephant space-use from a conservation landscape in Northeast India.•Forests in the matrix lessen edge effects and, with ruggedness, shape connectivity.•We present a non-invasive, widely applicable approach to understand connectivity.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edselp&AN=S0006320720309320&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Reconciled by a spatial connectivity model, we determined the best locations for the creation or restoration of 25 ponds to facilitate their natural colonisation, and to reconnect areas with similar genetic makeup whilst preserving differences between populations belonging to separate genetic clusters. A dynamic occupancy model based on data derived from standardised surveys revealed that both detection and occupancy probabilities strongly depended on habitat features known to be locally favourable for T. cristatus. At least 12 of the 25 new ponds were colonised within six years, representing a 26% increase in number of breeding ponds in the region and offsetting a gradual decline in number of pre-existing breeding sites recorded over the last 3 decades.

Nous examinons la dynamique spatiale des saumons sockeyes (Oncorhynchus nerka) frayant dans 36 cours d'eau du bassin versant de la rivière Stuart (Colombie-Britannique, Canada), en utilisant des données d'abondance de géniteurs couvrant 69 années et un modèle d'occupation dynamique bayésien basé sur la démographie. Nous cernons un ensemble de 12 cours d'eau caractérisés par de bonnes conditions d'habitat qui étaient occupés >90 % des années, malgré d'importantes variations interannuelles de l'abondance. Plus de 85 % des géniteurs étaient concentrés dans ces cours d'eau. De nombreux autres cours d'eau présentant des habitats de moins bonne qualité ont accueilli de plus petites populations non persistantes dans le temps et ont été recolonisés périodiquement par des individus provenant d'autres cours d'eau arrivés par dispersion. Bien qu'il soit souvent présumé que l'utilisation de tous les habitats disponibles maximise la diversité et la résilience des populations, pour cette métapopulation de saumons, la résilience est due aux principaux cours d'eau dont les habitats sont de bonne qualité. Si la contribution actuelle d'autres cours d'eau à l'abondance des populations est faible, certains pourraient être intéressants pour la conservation à l'avenir si leurs habitats deviennent plus propices au frai.

First, we employed environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys to efficiently generate multiseason rangewide site occupancy histories. Second, we developed a novel dynamic, spatial multiscale occupancy model to estimate metapopulation dynamics. The model incorporates spatial relationships, explicitly accounts for non‐detection bias and allows direct evaluation of the drivers of extinction and colonization. We applied these tools to examine metapopulation dynamics of endangered tidewater goby, a species endemic to California estuarine habitats. We analysed rangewide eDNA data from 190 geographically isolated sites (813 total water samples) surveyed from 2 years (2016 and 2017). Rangewide estimates of the proportion of sites that were occupied varied little between 2016 (0.52) and 2017 (0.51). However, there was evidence of extinction and colonization dynamics. The probability of extinction of an occupied site (0.106) and probability of colonization of an unoccupied site (0.085) were nearly equal. Stability in site occupancy proportions combined with nearly equal rates of extinction and colonization suggests a dynamic equilibrium between the 2 years surveyed. Assessment of covariate effects revealed that colonization probability increased as the number of occupied neighbouring sites increased and as distance between occupied sites decreased. We show that eDNA surveys can rapidly provide a snapshot of a species distribution over a broad geographic range and, when these surveys are paired with occupancy modelling, can uncover metapopulation dynamics and their drivers.

The use of attractants and surrounding microhabitats is likely to influence detection probabilities and survey outcomes; however, few studies consider these factors. We compared three attractants (peanut butter‐based, tuna‐based and a control) in a Latin square design through a coastal shrubland with high microhabitat variability at Cape Otway, Victoria, Australia (38º50ʹS, 143º30ʹE). Deployments involved 36 cameras for four days in each of five years. The percentage cover of each vegetation structural type (low [no or sparse cover], moderate [grass] or high [shrubs]) within 20 m of each camera was calculated and reduced to a single variable using PCA. Dynamic occupancy modelling, with lure type and vegetation structure as covariates of detection probability, found that peanut butter attracted the greatest diversity of species (24 of 35 species, 69%) and yielded the greatest number of detections (50% of 319) when compared with tuna oil (66% and 24%, respectively) and the control (43% and 26%, respectively). Peanut butter attracted more Macropodidae (wallabies) and Muridae (rats and mice); however, vegetation structural variables were the greatest influence on Corvidae/Artamidae (raven/currawong) detections with higher detectability in more open areas. Vegetation structure also influenced Muridae detections. This study reinforces the critical choice of appropriate attractants and camera placement when investigating vertebrate groups and highlights the role of microhabitat in the detection of small mammals and birds. We suggest future large‐scale camera surveys consider different bait types and microhabitats in their designs, to control for any biases and enable future advice on 'optimal' methods.

"Long‐term effects of colonization–extinction dynamics of generalist versus specialist wood‐decaying fungi.","Moor, Helen; Nordén, Jenni; Penttilä, Reijo; Siitonen, Juha; Snäll, Tord; Singh, Brajesh","Journal of Ecology",="00220477",,="Jan2021","109","1","491","13","148069659",,"Wiley-Blackwell","Article","WOOD-decaying fungi; FOREST productivity; POPULATION viability analysis; SPECIALISTS; LANDSCAPE changes; DYNAMIC models","colonization–extinction dynamics; decomposer fungi; dynamic occupancy model; ecological specialization; forestry; land‐use scenario; landscape ecology; metapopulation","Long‐term metapopulation persistence is mediated by the dynamics of colonization and extinction. To understand and predict future species occupancy in changing landscapes, we must account for the dynamic rates that shape the occupancy and disentangle their dependence on environmental conditions. Specialist and generalist species may differ in their dynamics in systematic ways.Using an extensive, large‐scale repeat survey dataset for wood‐decaying fungi, we fitted dynamic metapopulation models for ten species, ranging from generalists to specialists with differing resource requirements. We first estimated base rates of colonization and extinction and tested their relationships to species' degree of specialization. We then tested for effects of local and landscape scale variables on the colonization and extinction rates. Finally, using the fitted models and a scenario of future forest development we projected future colonization–extinction dynamics over 100 years to test for differences in species occupancies between production stands and set‐aside stands.Our study revealed a striking pattern of decreasing colonization rates with increasing degree of specialization across species, along with concomitantly increasing extinction rates. Strong sensitivity of colonization probabilities to local habitat quality (dead wood volume and stand age) in specialist but not generalist species constrained the regional occupancy of specialists, especially in production forest. We found evidence for short‐range dispersal limitation in two specialists, but no effect of our measure for landscape‐scale connectivity on colonization rates. Simulations of future metapopulation dynamics resulted in decreasing and lower final occupancy in production forest than in set‐asides, especially of specialist species. In set‐aside stands, however, specialists increased over time to relatively high occupancies.Synthesis. Colonization–extinction dynamics of wood‐decaying fungi varied with species' degree of specialization. Increasing specialization was associated with increasing sensitivity of colonization rates to habitat conditions, and partly local connectivity, as well as with increasing extinction rates. Low landscape‐scale occupancies of specialist as compared to generalist wood‐decaying fungi are thus maintained by a combination of lower colonization rates, particularly in production forest, and higher extinction rates.

In particular, occupancy‐based methods are often recommended for monitoring species, allowing researchers to track population trends using detection–non‐detection data alone. Occupancy models, however, have proven difficult to apply to rare, highly mobile species. Species' movements outside of sampling areas may lead to violation of the geographic closure assumption of occupancy models and overestimated occupancy probability. Low detection probability may further inflate occupancy probability estimates. We developed a novel continuous‐time, multi‐scale occupancy model to simultaneously account for closure assumption violations and low detection probability. We used a simulation study to test our model relative to a discrete‐time multi‐scale model, and we conducted a power analysis to assess the ability of an instantaneous occupancy parameter to detect trends in abundance, relative to standard occupancy alone. The continuous‐time model was competitive with the discrete‐time model and was generally computationally faster than and outperformed the discrete‐time model when detection probability was low. The instantaneous occupancy parameter outperformed occupancy in terms of power to detect trends when we used an implicit (i.e., estimating occupancy independently in each primary occasion) dynamic occupancy model, but performed no better when we used an explicit (i.e., estimating colonization and extinction) dynamic occupancy model. We applied both discrete‐time and continuous‐time multi‐scale occupancy models to a case study of data collected on wolverines (Gulo gulo) in Washington, USA. We found improved precision in estimates with the continuous‐time model and that asymptotic occupancy of wolverines was high, but short‐term use of any given area was low. Our multi‐scale, continuous‐time occupancy model can be used to detect trends in abundance of rare, highly mobile species, regardless of how occupancy dynamics are modeled. Furthermore, our model can allow for more efficient data collection and analysis than traditional discrete‐time or spatially multi‐scale approaches, as our model uses all available detections and requires only one detector per sampling unit by substituting time for space.

Most sites were visited several times during a breeding season to survey occupancy and later fecundity, but the proportion of sites visited was highly variable over the years. We highlight the power of the Bayesian implementation of site-occupancy models (MacKenzie et al. 2002, 2003) to analyze data from raptor population studies: to correct population size estimates for sites not visited in a given year and for the biasing effects of preferential sampling (when better sites are more likely to be checked). In addition, these models allow estimation and modeling of the site-level persistence and colonization rates, which can provide important clues about drivers of population dynamics, even without individually marking any birds.

We used dynamic occupancy models, which allow the territory-specific extinction and colonization parameters – the demographic rates (at the territory level) underlying a population trend – to be estimated. The Swiss peregrine population has developed in line with trends observed in many other countries and regions in North America and Europe: after the pesticide-induced collapse between the 1950s and 1970s, the population largely recovered up to the turn of the millennium. However, in recent years, we detected significant declines again: in SW Switzerland, the population decreased from 51 to 33 pairs during 2008–2015 (-35%), in the N Jura from 70 to 40 pairs during 2009–2015 (-43%) and in Zurich from 6–7 to 2–4 pairs during 2010–2015 (-50%).

We discuss two factors responsible for these strong, recent declines of Swiss peregrines: (1) predation by Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo) and (2) direct and illegal persecution by humans. In addition to these two factors, growing human disturbance (e.g. through climbers, bird photographers, paragliders, hikers, geocachers, etc.) and fatalities due to collisions with man-made structures (power lines, glass, wind turbines, etc.) are also suspected to contribute to the population decline.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsdoj&AN=edsdoj.9e78d018253e457f9663f16b96437642&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

It demands data at adequate spatial scales and over extended periods of time, which may only be obtained through collaborative efforts, and the development of methods that integrate heterogeneous datasets. We aimed to combine existing data on large carnivores to evaluate population dynamics and improve knowledge on their distribution nationwide.Botswana.Between 2010 and 2016, we collated data on African wild dog, cheetah, leopard, brown and spotted hyaena and lion gathered with different survey methods by independent researchers across Botswana. We used a multi‐species, multi‐method dynamic occupancy model to analyse factors influencing occupancy, persistence and colonization, while accounting for imperfect detection. Lastly, we used the gained knowledge to predict the probability of occurrence of each species countrywide.Wildlife areas and communal rangelands had similar occupancy probabilities for most species. Large carnivore occupancy was low in commercial farming areas and where livestock density was high, except for brown hyaena. Lion occupancy was negatively associated with human density; lion and spotted hyaena occupancy was high where rainfall was high, while the opposite applied to brown hyaena. Lion and leopard occupancy remained constant countrywide over the study period. African wild dog and cheetah occupancy declined over time in the south and north, respectively, whereas both hyaena species expanded their ranges. Countrywide predictions identified the highest occupancy for leopards and lowest for the two hyaena species.We highlight the necessity of data sharing and propose a generalizable analytical method that addresses the challenges of heterogeneous data common in ecology. Our approach, which enables a comprehensive multi‐species assessment at large spatial and temporal scales, supports the development of data‐driven conservation guidelines and the implementation of evidence‐based management strategies nationally and internationally.

Climate suitability is characterized using ecological niche models (ENMs), which correlate species occurrence data with current environmental covariates and project future distributions using the modeled relationships together with climate predictions. Despite their widespread adoption, ENMs rely on several assumptions that are rarely validated in situ and can be highly sensitive to modeling decisions, precluding their reliability in conservation decision‐making. Using data from a novel, large‐scale community science program, we developed dynamic occupancy models to validate near‐term climate suitability projections for bluebirds and nuthatches in summer and winter. We estimated occupancy, colonization, and extinction dynamics across species' ranges in the United States in relation to projected climate suitability in the 2020s, and used a Gibbs variable selection approach to quantify evidence of species–climate relationships. We also included a Bird Conservation Region strata‐level random effect to examine among‐strata variation in occupancy that may be attributable to land‐use and ecoregional differences. Across species and seasons, we found strong evidence that initial occupancy and colonization were positively related to 2020 climate suitability, illustrating an independent validation of projections from ENMs across a large geographic area. Random strata effects revealed that occupancy probabilities were generally higher than average in core areas and lower than average in peripheral areas of species' ranges, and served as a first step in identifying spatial patterns of occupancy from these community science data. Our findings lend much‐needed support to the use of ENM projections for addressing questions about potential climate‐induced changes in species' occupancy dynamics. More broadly, our work highlights the value of community scientist observations for ground‐truthing projections from statistical models and for refining our understanding of the processes shaping species' distributions under a changing climate.

Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and were recently recommended for delisting. Predicted climate‐driven losses in habitat quality and quantity may negatively affect the north‐eastern Minnesota lynx population, one of the six remaining resident populations in the contiguous United States. We develop a large‐scale monitoring protocol and dynamic occupancy modelling framework to identify multi‐year core‐use areas and track spatiotemporal occurrence at the southern periphery of the species range. Location: North‐eastern Minnesota lynx geographic unit, Superior National Forest and designated critical habitat, Minnesota, USA. Methods: Spatially and temporally replicated snow track surveys were used to collect lynx detection/non‐detection data across five winters (2014–15 to 2018–19) covering >17,000 km within the 22,100 km2 study area. We used a dynamic occupancy model to evaluate lynx occupancy, persistence, colonization and habitat covariates affecting these processes. Results: Lynx occupancy probabilities displayed high spatial and temporal variability, with grid cell‐specific probabilities ranging from 0.0 in periphery regions to consistently near 1.0 in multi‐year core‐use areas, indicating low turnover rates in those areas. Lynx colonization and persistence increased in areas with more evergreen forest and greater average snowfall, while forest characteristics (3–5 and 10–30 m vegetation density) had mixed relationships with occupancy dynamics. We identified 55 grid cells classified as multi‐year core‐use areas across relatively contiguous regions of high average snowfall and per cent conifer forest. Main conclusions: Our study demonstrates a landscape‐scale multi‐year monitoring programme assessing the effects of habitat characteristics and anthropogenic factors on species distributional changes and landscape‐level occupancy dynamics. Our framework incorporating landscape‐scale resource selection, core‐use area concepts and dynamic occupancy models provides a flexible approach to identify population‐level mechanisms driving species persistence and key areas for conservation protection.

Various automated control systems of shading device and electric lighting have been widely used. However, existing lighting and shading systems typically operate independently, i.e., information is not shared, and thus system performance is not optimal. Therefore, integrated control systems have been proposed to maximize energy efficiency and user comfort. Some problems are still unaddressed. For example, the benefits of sharing control information (e.g., HVAC state and occupancy information) between the lighting and shading control systems have not been quantified; the benefits of integrated controls have not been quantified. To address these issues, improved independent and integrated control strategies were proposed by adding shared HVAC state and occupancy information. To provide a quantitative comparison of these control strategies, a co-simulation platform consisting of BCVTB, EnergyPlus and Matlab was developed to perform an in-depth quantitative study of seven control strategies (manual, independent and integrated control strategies). Simulation results for a reference office building were presented for three climate zones (Baltimore, London, Abu-Dhabi), two types of blinds (interior, exterior) and two window-to-wall ratios (66%, 100%). A dynamic occupancy model was developed from actual office occupancy data and used in the simulations. The lighting, heating and cooling energy consumption, electric demand and visual comfort of different control strategies were evaluated and compared.

Intensive management of RABV by oral rabies vaccination (ORV) has prevented its spread westward and shown evidence of local elimination in raccoon populations of the northeastern US. The USDA, Wildlife Services, National Rabies Management Program (NRMP) collaborates with other agencies to implement broad-scale ORV and conducts extensive monitoring to measure the effectiveness of the management. Enhanced Rabies Surveillance (ERS) was initiated during 2005 and updated in 2016 to direct surveillance efforts toward higher-value specimens by assigning points to different methods of encountering specimens for collection (strange-acting, roadkill, surveillance-trapped, etc.; specimen point values ranged from 1 to 15). We used the 2016–2019 data to re-evaluate the point values using a dynamic occupancy model. Additionally, we used ERS data from 2012–2015 and 2016–2019 to examine the impact that the point system had on surveillance data. Implementation of a point system increased positivity rates among specimens by 64%, indicating a substantial increase in the efficiency of the ERS to detect wildlife rabies. Our re-evaluation found that most points accurately reflect the value of the surveillance specimens. The notable exception was that samples from animals found dead were considerably more valuable for rabies detection than originally considered (original points = 5, new points = 20). This work demonstrates how specimen prioritization strategies can be used to refine and improve ERS in support of wildlife rabies management.

This can result in underestimates of occupancy, where nondetection is conflated with absence. The site occupancy model (SOM) overcomes this failure by treating occupancy as a latent variable of the model and incorporates a detection submodel to account for variability in detection rates. These have rarely been applied in the context of marine fish and never for the multiseason dynamic occupancy model (DOM). In this study, a DOM is developed for a designated species of concern, cusk (Brosme brosme), over a four‐season period. Making novel use of a high‐resolution 3‐dimensional hydrodynamic model, detectability of cusk is considered as a function of current speed and algae cover. Algal cover on the seabed is measured from video surveys to divide the study area into two distinct regions: those with canopy forming species of algae and those without (henceforth bottom types). Modeled estimates of the proportion of sites occupied in each season are 0.88, 0.45, 0.74, and 0.83. These are significantly greater than the proportion of occupied sites measured from underwater video observations which are 0.57, 0.28, 0.43, and 0.57. Individual fish are detected more frequently with increasing current speed in areas lacking canopy and less frequently with increasing current speed in areas with canopy. The results indicate that, where possible, SDM studies for all marine species should take account of detectability to avoid underestimating the proportion of sites occupied at a given study area. Sampling closed areas or areas of conservation often requires the use of nonphysical, low impact sampling methods like camera surveys. These methods inherently result in detection probabilities less than one, an issue compounded by time‐varying features of the environment that are rarely accounted for marine studies. This work highlights the use of modeled hydrodynamics as a tool to correct some of this imbalance. Detection of marine fish is often not considered when mapping their distributions. This study considers detectability as a function of hydrodynamics and bottom type. Findings show how considering detection probability affects occupancy estimates for marine fish in an area of conservation for a priority species.

First, we employed environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys to efficiently generate multiseason rangewide site occupancy histories. Second, we developed a novel dynamic, spatial multiscale occupancy model to estimate metapopulation dynamics. The model incorporates spatial relationships, explicitly accounts for non-detection bias and allows direct evaluation of the drivers of extinction and colonization. We applied these tools to examine metapopulation dynamics of endangered tidewater goby, a species endemic to California estuarine habitats. We analysed rangewide eDNA data from 190 geographically isolated sites (813 total water samples) surveyed from 2 years (2016 and 2017). Rangewide estimates of the proportion of sites that were occupied varied little between 2016 (0.52) and 2017 (0.51). However, there was evidence of extinction and colonization dynamics. The probability of extinction of an occupied site (0.106) and probability of colonization of an unoccupied site (0.085) were nearly equal. Stability in site occupancy proportions combined with nearly equal rates of extinction and colonization suggests a dynamic equilibrium between the 2 years surveyed. Assessment of covariate effects revealed that colonization probability increased as the number of occupied neighbouring sites increased and as distance between occupied sites decreased. We show that eDNA surveys can rapidly provide a snapshot of a species distribution over a broad geographic range and, when these surveys are paired with occupancy modelling, can uncover metapopulation dynamics and their drivers.

In particular, occupancy‐based methods are often recommended for monitoring species, allowing researchers to track population trends using detection–non‐detection data alone. Occupancy models, however, have proven difficult to apply to rare, highly mobile species. Species’ movements outside of sampling areas may lead to violation of the geographic closure assumption of occupancy models and overestimated occupancy probability. Low detection probability may further inflate occupancy probability estimates. We developed a novel continuous‐time, multi‐scale occupancy model to simultaneously account for closure assumption violations and low detection probability. We used a simulation study to test our model relative to a discrete‐time multi‐scale model, and we conducted a power analysis to assess the ability of an instantaneous occupancy parameter to detect trends in abundance, relative to standard occupancy alone. The continuous‐time model was competitive with the discrete‐time model and was generally computationally faster than and outperformed the discrete‐time model when detection probability was low. The instantaneous occupancy parameter outperformed occupancy in terms of power to detect trends when we used an implicit (i.e., estimating occupancy independently in each primary occasion) dynamic occupancy model, but performed no better when we used an explicit (i.e., estimating colonization and extinction) dynamic occupancy model. We applied both discrete‐time and continuous‐time multi‐scale occupancy models to a case study of data collected on wolverines (Gulo gulo) in Washington, USA. We found improved precision in estimates with the continuous‐time model and that asymptotic occupancy of wolverines was high, but short‐term use of any given area was low. Our multi‐scale, continuous‐time occupancy model can be used to detect trends in abundance of rare, highly mobile species, regardless of how occupancy dynamics are modeled. Furthermore, our model can allow for more efficient data collection and analysis than traditional discrete‐time or spatially multi‐scale approaches, as our model uses all available detections and requires only one detector per sampling unit by substituting time for space.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsdoj&AN=edsdoj.b54c7cf83e40472081164aa09cc503a5&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

However, mitigating cat impacts remains challenging. Understanding the factors that facilitate coexistence between native prey and their alien predators could aid better pest management and conservation actions. Aims: We estimated feral cat density, examined the impact of habitat cover on long-nosed potoroos (Potorous tridactylus tridactylus), and assessed the spatial and temporal interactions between cats and potoroos in the 'Bluegums' area of French Island, south-eastern Australia. Materials and methods: We operated 31 camera stations across Bluegums for 99 consecutive nights in each of winter 2018 and summer 2018/19. We used a spatially explicit capture–recapture model to estimate cat density, and two-species single-season occupancy models to assess spatial co-occurrence of cats and potoroos. We assessed the influence of vegetation cover and cat activity on potoroo activity by using a dynamic occupancy model. We also used image timestamps to describe and compare the temporal activities of the two species. Key results: Bluegums had a density of 0.77 cats per km2 across both seasons, although this is a conservative estimate because of the presence of unidentified cats. Cats and long-nosed potoroos were detected at 94% and 77% of camera stations, respectively. Long-nosed potoroo detectability was higher in denser vegetation and this pattern was stronger at sites with high cat activity. Cats and potoroos overlapped in their temporal activity, but their peak activity times differed. Conclusions: Feral cat density at Bluegums, French Island, is higher than has been reported for mainland Australian sites, but generally lower than in other islands. Long-nosed potoroos were positively associated with cats, potentially indicating cats tracking potoroos as prey or other prey species that co-occur with potoroos. Temporal activity of each species differed, and potoroos sought more complex habitat, highlighting possible mechanisms potoroos may use to reduce their predation risk when co-occurring with cats. Implications: Our study highlighted how predator and prey spatial and temporal interactions, and habitat cover and complexity (ecological refuges), may influence the ability for native prey to coexist with invasive predators. We encourage more consideration and investigation of these factors, with the aim of facilitating more native species to persist with invasive predators or be reintroduced outside of predator-free sanctuaries, exclosures and island safe havens. Feral domestic cats have contributed to a substantial loss of Australian wildlife, but management of their impacts remains challenging. The present study aimed to examine how a population of long-nosed potoroos is coexisting with feral cats and showed that a 'moderate' cat density, temporal avoidance and predation-risk minimisation, and refuge availability are likely to be important. This information may facilitate better conservation actions, including potential species reintroductions, in the extensive areas currently occupied by feral cats.

Ici, nous avons utilisé les données du programme de science citoyenne SwiftWatch d'Études d'Oiseaux Canada, Ontario, ainsi que des modèles dynamiques d'occupation pour examiner les facteurs influant sur la probabilité de détecter des Martinets ramoneurs aux sites de nidification. Nous avons constaté que la probabilité de détecter des Martinets ramoneurs près des cheminées utilisées comme nichoir diminuait avec l'augmentation de la couverture nuageuse. Nous avons également trouvé des éléments suggérant que la détection augmentait modérément avec la date durant la période de nidification (juinjuillet). D'après nos résultats, nous recommandons que les relevés visant à identifier les sites de nidification du Martinet ramoneur dans le sud de l'Ontario, au Canada, soient effectués par temps clair, pendant au moins une heure, et aussi tard que possible pendant la période de nidification. Les résultats de cette étude amélioreront la conception des relevés afin de réduire l'incidence des faux négatifs lors des relevés des cheminées pour déterminer l'occupation du nid et, par conséquent, contribueront à réduire les perturbations et la perte de l'habitat de nidification du Martinet ramoneur.

Fire has spatially variable effects on landscapes; however, for species that benefit from the ephemeral resource patches created by fire, it is critical to understand characteristics of fires that promote postfire colonization and persistence and the spatial scales on which they operate. Using a model postfire specialist, the black‐backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), we examined how colonization and persistence varied across two spatial scales as a function of four characteristics of fire regimes—fire severity, fire size, fire ignition date and number of years since fire. We modelled black‐backed woodpecker colonization and persistence using data from 108 recently burned forests in the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades ecoregions of California, USA, that we monitored for up to 10 years following fire. We employed a novel, spatially hierarchical, dynamic occupancy framework which differentiates colonization and persistence at two spatial scales: across fires and within fires. We found strong effects of fire characteristics on dynamic rates, with colonization and persistence declining across both spatial scales with increasing years since fire. Additionally, at sites within fires, colonization decreased with fire size and increased with fire severity and for fires with later ignition dates. Our results support the notion that different aspects of a species’ environment are important for population processes at different spatial scales. As habitat quality is ephemeral for any given postfire area, our results illustrate the importance of time since fire in structuring occupancy at the fire level, with other characteristics of fires playing larger roles in determining abundance within individual fires. Our results contribute to the broader understanding of how variation in fire characteristics influences the colonization and persistence of species using ephemeral habitats, which is necessary for conserving and promoting postfire biodiversity in the context of rapidly shifting fire regimes.

Identifying the direct and indirect interactions among sympatric carnivores that enable their coexistence is particularly important to elucidate because they are integral for maintaining ecosystem function. We studied the effects of removing nine fishers (<italic>Pekania pennanti)</italic> on their population dynamics and used this perturbation to elucidate the interspecific interactions among fishers, grey foxes (<italic>Urocyon cinereoargenteus</italic>) and ringtails (<italic>Bassariscus astutus</italic>). Grey foxes (family: Canidae) are likely to compete with fishers due to their similar body sizes and dietary overlap, and ringtails (family: Procyonidae), like fishers, are semi‐arboreal species of conservation concern. We used spatial capture–recapture to investigate fisher population numbers and dynamic occupancy models that incorporated interspecific interactions to investigate the effects members of these species had on the colonization and persistence of each other's site occupancy. The fisher population showed no change in density for up to 3 years following the removals of fishers for translocations. In contrast, fisher site occupancy decreased in the years immediately following the translocations. During this same time period, site occupancy by grey foxes increased and remained elevated through the end of the study. We found a complicated hierarchy among fishers, foxes and ringtails. Fishers affected grey fox site persistence negatively but had a positive effect on their colonization. Foxes had a positive effect on ringtail site colonization. Thus, fishers were the dominant small carnivore where present and negatively affected foxes directly and ringtails indirectly. Coexistence among the small carnivores we studied appears to reflect dynamic spatial partitioning. Conservation and management efforts should investigate how intraguild interactions may influence the recolonization of carnivores to previously occupied landscapes.

However, few versions of the model relate these probabilities to the occupancies of neighboring sites or patches. We present a modeling framework that incorporates this information and is capable of describing a wide variety of spatiotemporal colonization and extinction processes. A key feature of the model is that it is based on a simple set of small-scale rules describing how the process evolves. The result is a dynamic process that can account for complicated large-scale features. In our model, a site is more likely to be colonized if more of its neighbors were previously occupied and if it provides more appealing environmental characteristics than its neighboring sites. Additionally, a site without occupied neighbors may also become colonized through the inclusion of a long-distance dispersal process. Although similar model specifications have been developed for epidemiological applications, ours formally accounts for detectability using the well-known occupancy modeling framework. After demonstrating the viability and potential of this new form of dynamic occupancy model in a simulation study, we use it to obtain inference for the ongoing Common Myna ( Acridotheres tristis) invasion in South Africa. Our results suggest that the Common Myna continues to enlarge its distribution and its spread via short distance movement, rather than long-distance dispersal. Overall, this new modeling framework provides a powerful tool for managers examining the drivers of colonization including short- vs. long-distance dispersal, habitat quality, and distance from source populations.

Identifying the parts of species' distributions most vulnerable to local extinction would benefit conservation planning. However, previous studies give little consensus on whether ranges decline to the core or edge. We built on previous work by using empirical data to examine the position of recent local extinctions within species' geographic ranges, address range position as a continuum, and explore the influence of environmental factors. We aggregated point-locality data for 125 Galliform species from across the Palearctic and Indo-Malaya into equal-area half-degree grid cells and used a multispecies dynamic Bayesian occupancy model to estimate rates of local extinctions. Our model provides a novel approach to identify loss of populations from within species ranges. We investigated the relationship between extinction rates and distance from range edge by examining whether patterns were consistent across biogeographic realm and different categories of land use. In the Palearctic, local extinctions occurred closer to the range edge than range core in both unconverted and human-dominated landscapes. In Indo-Malaya, no pattern was found for unconverted landscapes, but in human-dominated landscapes extinctions tended to occur closer to the core than the edge. Our results suggest that local and regional factors override general spatial patterns of recent local extinction within species' ranges and highlight the difficulty of predicting the parts of a species' distribution most vulnerable to threat.

La identificación de las partes de la distribución de las especies más vulnerables a la extinción local beneficiaría a la planeación de la conservación. Sin embargo, los estudios prestigiosos dan poco consenso sobre si las extensiones declinan hacia el núcleo o hacia los bordes. Partimos de trabajos previos usando datos empíricos para examinar la posición de las extinciones locales recientes dentro de las extensiones geográficas de las especies, tratar a la posición de la extensión como un continuo y explorar la influencia de los factores ambientales. Añadimos datos de puntos de localidad de 125 especies de galliformes de las regiones Paleártica e Indo-Malaya a celdas de una cuadrícula de medio grado y de área equitativa y utilizamos un modelo multiespecie de ocupación bayesiana dinámica para estimar la tasa de extinciones locales. Nuestro modelo proporciona una estrategia novedosa para identificar la pérdida de las poblaciones desde dentro de la extensión de las especies. Investigamos la relación entre las tasas de extinción y la distancia a partir del borde de la extensión comprobando si los patrones eran consistentes a lo largo del reino biogeográfico y en diferentes categorías de uso de suelo. En la Paleártica, las extinciones locales ocurrieron más cerca del borde de la extensión que del núcleo tanto en los paisajes sin conversión como en aquellos dominados por el humano. En la Indo-Malaya, no se encontró un patrón para los paisajes sin conversión, pero en los paisajes dominados por el humano las extinciones tendieron a suceder más cerca del núcleo que del borde de la extensión. Nuestros resultados sugieren que los factores locales y regionales invalidan los patrones espaciales generales de las extinciones locales recientes dentro de la extensión de las especies y resaltan la dificultad de predecir las partes de la distribución de las especies que son más vulnerables a la amenaza.

Other facets of diversity such as functional diversity are also rarely explored. We investigated the avian diversity-landscape heterogeneity relationship in agricultural landscapes by considering two aspects of diversity: taxonomic diversity (species richness) estimated from a multi-species dynamic occupancy model, and functional diversity (functional evenness [FEve] and divergence [FDiv]) based on traits of occurring species. We also assessed how agricultural lands enrolled in a conservation program managed on behalf of declining early successional bird species (hereafter CP38 fields, an agri-environment scheme) influenced avian diversity. We analyzed breeding bird data collected at CP38 fields in Mississippi, USA, during 2010–2012, and two principal components of environmental variables: a gradient of heterogeneity (Shannon’s landscape diversity index) and of the amount of CP38 fields (percent cover of CP38 fields; CP38). FEve did not show significant responses to environmental variables, whereas FDiv responded positively to heterogeneity and negatively to CP38. However, most FDiv values did not significantly differ from random expectations along an environmental gradient. When there was a significant difference, FDiv was lower than that expected. Unlike functional diversity, species richness showed a clear pattern. Species richness increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity but decreased with increasing amounts of CP38 fields. Only one species responded negatively to heterogeneity and positively to CP38. Our results suggest that the relationships between avian diversity and landscape heterogeneity may vary depending on the aspect of diversity considered: strong positive effects of heterogeneity on taxonomic diversity, but weakly positive or non-significant effects on functional diversity. Our results also indicate that effectiveness of CP38 in conserving avian diversity, particularly, taxonomic diversity, could be limited without the consideration of landscape heterogeneity.

This assumption is rarely evaluated, and there is a need to understand the degree of connectivity among patches to appropriately define, manage, and conserve biological populations. Objectives: Our objectives were to quantify local persistence, colonization, and recruitment (metademographic rates) in relation to habitat attributes, evaluate the influence of the spatial arrangement of patches on landscape-scale population dynamics, and estimate the scale at which metapopulation dynamics are occurring for Oregon spotted frog (Rana pretiosa). Methods: We collected R. pretiosa detection/non-detection data and habitat information from 93 sites spread throughout the species' extant range in Oregon, USA, 2010–2018. We developed a spatial multistate dynamic occupancy model to analyze these data. Results: The proportion of sites occupied by R. pretiosa was relatively stable despite regular turnover in site occupancy. Connectivity was greatest when the distance between sites was within 4.49–7.70 km, and the results suggested that populations within 1 km are at the appropriate spatial scale for effective population management. Rana pretiosa metademographic rates were strongly tied to water availability, vegetation characteristics, and beaver dams. Conclusions: Our analysis provides critical information to identify the appropriate spatial scale for effective population management, estimates the distance at which populations are connected, and quantifies the effects of hypothesized threats to species at a landscape scale. We believe this model will prove to be useful to inform conservation and management strategies for multiple species.

However, there have been few attempts to schedule actions across broad spatial extents that explicitly account for dynamic ecological processes and threats., We combined a dynamic occupancy model with a decision analysis framework to spatially allocate multiple recovery actions to maximize species' probability of occupancy under threats posed by climate and land-use change. We used the koala Phascolarctos cinereus across the Australian state of New South Wales (810 000 km2) to illustrate this approach. We considered four actions implemented on a 10 × 10 km2 grid: reduce domestic dog attacks through dog control, reduce vehicle collisions through fencing highways, protect habitat through land acquisitions and restore Eucalyptus forest. We used the occupancy model to predict ecological responses to recovery actions and simulated annealing to identify spatio-temporal priorities for each action. We contrasted the results against priorities generated using a traditional static distribution model., To maximize the probability of koala occupancy in 50 years' time, with an annual budget of up to AU$20 million, investment priorities were located in the eastern part of koala's range, focusing on dog control with some investment in habitat protection and restoration. With higher budgets, investment priorities shifted towards habitat protection and restoration in the western part of the range. However, priorities based on the static distribution model, which had a lower predictive accuracy than the dynamic model, were different. Regardless of budget, priorities derived from the static model were predominantly located in the western part of koala's range, focusing on highway fencing with some investment in dog control., Synthesis and applications. Our approach for integrating spatio-temporal dynamics into conservation prioritization across broad spatial extents provides a significant advance on existing approaches based on static distribution models. The finding that the inferior static model produced different priorities to the dynamic model cautions against the use of static models for conservation planning in dynamic landscapes. Additionally, the substantial changes in priorities with budget indicate that conservation planning under dynamic landscape and climate change must carefully consider priority actions and locations relative to the conservation resources available.

Location New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Methods We used data on koala ( Phascolarctos cinereus) presence and absence collected across the state of NSW from public surveys between 1987 and 2011. A dynamic occupancy model was built to quantify the role of climate and land use change on koala extinction risk and occupancy. We contrasted the model results against the more usual static occupancy model approach. We then developed scenarios of future climate, land clearing and urbanization and predicted the distribution of the koalas over the next 20 years based on the dynamic occupancy model. Results The static model indicates koala occupancy in 1987 and in 2011 depended most strongly on annual rainfall and distance to water features. Housing density and its interaction with Eucalyptus forest cover only minimally affected koala occupancy. However, for the dynamic occupancy model, extinction risk (the metric of dominant concern for species conservation) depended most strongly on Eucalyptus forest cover and its interaction with housing density, while annual rainfall only minimally affected extinction risk. We predicted extinction risk to be higher in western NSW than in the east and that extinction risk may increase under future scenarios of climate and land use change. Main conclusions This study underlines the importance of incorporating extinction dynamics when modelling species distributional shifts under climate and land use change and we provide an approach for doing so using public-based surveys. As conservation objectives usually aim to maximize persistence, this is likely to lead to more reliable identification of conservation priorities than using static species distribution models. Combining public-based surveys and dynamic occupancy models provides a powerful approach for achieving this across broad spatial extents, thus providing an alternative approach when field-based data collection is impractical.

An important component of adaptive management is identifying clear, measurable conservation objectives that reflect the desired outcomes of stakeholders. A common objective is to have a sustainable population, or metapopulation, but it can be difficult to quantify a threshold above which such a population is likely to persist. We performed a Bayesian metapopulation viability analysis (BMPVA) using a dynamic occupancy model to quantify the characteristics of two wood frog (Lithobates sylvatica) metapopulations resulting in sustainable populations, and we demonstrate how the results could be used to define meaningful objectives that serve as the basis of adaptive management. We explored scenarios involving metapopulations with different numbers of patches (pools) using estimates of breeding occurrence and successful metamorphosis from two study areas to estimate the probability of quasi-extinction and calculate the proportion of vernal pools producing metamorphs. Our results suggest that ≥50 pools are required to ensure long-term persistence with approximately 16% of pools producing metamorphs in stable metapopulations. We demonstrate one way to incorporate the BMPVA results into a utility function that balances the trade-offs between ecological and financial objectives, which can be used in an adaptive management framework to make optimal, transparent decisions. Our approach provides a framework for using a standard method (i.e., PVA) and available information to inform a formal decision process to determine optimal and timely management policies.

The effect of survey effort on species detection has long been appreciated and Atlases typically include survey standards and records of effort, but challenges remain in analysing Atlas data that have not been collected using a repeated sampling protocol designed to correct for imperfect detection., We developed a single-visit dynamic occupancy model to quantify the effects of climatic and land-use drivers on local species extinction and colonization while accounting for imperfect detection using repeat Atlas data. We evaluated model stability using data simulated under alternative scenarios and, ultimately, applied the model to empirical data for Canada warbler Cardellina canadensis, a wide-spread species exhibiting a long-term population decline., At sample sizes that are realistic for many Atlases ( n = 1000-10 000 independent survey blocks), our models produced unbiased estimates of detection, occupancy, colonization and extinction parameters. Slope estimates for explanatory covariates were somewhat less stable than overall occupancy, colonization and extinction rates, with covariate effects being sensitive to the total number of, and relationships among, explanatory variables., In comparison to other analyses of Canada warbler distributions that indicated minor changes over time, our approach identified a widespread decline in occupancy probability across New York, consistent with the broader population trend, particularly in the areas where it was initially more likely to occur., Synthesis and applications. A single-visit dynamic occupancy model is a novel method for analysing common, ecologically valuable datasets, such as Atlases, that lack repeated sampling necessary to correct for imperfect detection using alternative multi-season occupancy modelling approaches. As a result, using this method can improve understanding of species distributions and factors that shape them over time, thereby providing more accurate information to guide conservation and management.

This is due to the lack of abundance data for these groups. However, alternative data such as occurrence records are available for a vast range of species and advances in methodologies are enabling their robust analysis. Here, I analyse UK occurrence records using Bayesian occupancy modelling techniques to determine the status, patterns and drivers of change in less well-studied taxa. First, variations of an occupancy modelling framework were tested to determine whether methods could be improved. This resulted in a ""random walk"" model that could analyse sparse occurrence records while producing results with increased precision and reduced bias when compared to other variants. This enabled the application of the model to data for over 12,000 species from 32 taxa including vascular plants and numerous invertebrate groups. The resulting estimates of annual occupancy present new information on large-scale change from fine-grained data. Exploration of these estimates showed that trends are not consistent with those of well-studied taxa. Occupancy estimates were then used to assess change in three forms of biodiversity trend: local alpha diversity, regional alpha diversity and regional beta diversity. This revealed the multifaceted nature of biodiversity change and the need to monitor across metrics and scales. Finally, a Bayesian, multispecies, dynamic occupancy model was used to determine the effect of water quality on the population dynamics of freshwater invertebrates. This work highlights the potential of occurrence records to investigate biodiversity change and brings to light new information on many species that have not previously been studied at a national scale.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsble&AN=edsble.771875&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

The USDA, Wildlife Services, National Rabies Management Program (NRMP) collaborates with other agencies to implement broad-scale ORV and conducts extensive monitoring to measure the effectiveness of the management. Enhanced Rabies Surveillance (ERS) was initiated during 2005 and updated in 2016 to direct surveillance efforts toward higher-value specimens by assigning points to different methods of encountering specimens for collection (strange-acting, roadkill, surveillance-trapped, etc.; specimen point values ranged from 1 to 15). We used the 2016–2019 data to re-evaluate the point values using a dynamic occupancy model. Additionally, we used ERS data from 2012–2015 and 2016–2019 to examine the impact that the point system had on surveillance data. Implementation of a point system increased positivity rates among specimens by 64%, indicating a substantial increase in the efficiency of the ERS to detect wildlife rabies. Our re-evaluation found that most points accurately reflect the value of the surveillance specimens. The notable exception was that samples from animals found dead were considerably more valuable for rabies detection than originally considered (original points = 5, new points = 20).

Capturing dynamic space-use patterns in a model-based framework is critical as model inference often drives place-based conservation planning. We applied dynamic occupancy models to broad-scale golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos survey data collected annually from 2006 to 2012 during the late summer post-fledging period in the western US. We defined survey sites as 10 km transect segments with a 1 km buffer on either transect side (n = 3540). Derived estimates of occupancy were low (4.4-7.9%) and turnover rates - the probability that occupied sites were newly occupied - were high (88-94%), demonstrating that annual transiency in occupancy dominates late summer behavior for golden eagles. Despite low philopatry during late summer, variation in golden eagle occupancy could be explained by a suite of land cover and annual-varying covariates including gross primary productivity, drought severity, and human disturbance. Our summary of 13 years of predicted occupancy by golden eagles across the western United States identified areas that are consistently used and that may contribute significantly to golden eagle conservation. Restricting development and targeting mitigation efforts in these areas offers practitioners a framework for conservation prioritization.

Carnivore coexistence may be facilitated by spatial segregation, temporal avoidance, and differential habitat selection. American martens Martes americana and fishers Pekania pennanti are medium‐sized mustelids that occur sympatrically across portions of North America, yet mechanisms of coexistence between the two species are not fully understood. We assessed spatial and temporal partitioning in martens and fishers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA, using camera trap data collected during winter 2013–2015. To investigate spatial segregation, we used a dynamic occupancy model to estimate species' occupancy probabilities and probabilities of persistence and colonization as a function of covariates and yearly occupancy probability for the other species. Temporal segregation was assessed by estimating diel activity overlap between species. We found weak evidence of spatial or temporal niche partitioning of martens and fishers. There was high overlap in forest cover selection, and both marten and fisher occupancy were positively correlated with deciduous forests (excluding aspen [Populus tremuloides]). There was strong temporal overlap (Δ^4=0.81; CI = 0.79–0.82) with both species exhibiting largely crepuscular activity patterns. Co‐occurrence of martens and fishers appears to be facilitated by mechanisms not investigated in this study, such as partitioning of snow features or diet. Our results add additional insights into resource partitioning of mesocarnivores, but further research is required to enhance our understanding of mechanisms that facilitate marten and fisher coexistence.

However, efficient monitoring of many large carnivore species is challenging due to their rarity, elusive behavior, and large home ranges. Their monitoring can include opportunistic sightings from citizens in addition to designed surveys. Two types of detection errors may occur in such monitoring schemes: false negatives and false positives. False‐negative detections can be accounted for in species distribution models (SDMs) that deal with imperfect detection. False‐positive detections, due to species misidentification, have rarely been accounted for in SDMs. Generally, researchers use ad hoc data‐filtering methods to discard ambiguous observations prior to analysis. These practices may discard valuable ecological information on the distribution of a species. We investigated the costs and benefits of including data types that may include false positives rather than discarding them for SDMs of large carnivores. We used a dynamic occupancy model that simultaneously accounts for false negatives and positives to jointly analyze data that included both unambiguous detections and ambiguous detections. We used simulations to compare the performances of our model with a model fitted on unambiguous data only. We tested the 2 models in 4 scenarios in which parameters that control false‐positive detections and true detections varied. We applied our model to data from the monitoring of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in the European Alps. The addition of ambiguous detections increased the precision of parameter estimates. For the Eurasian lynx, incorporating ambiguous detections produced more precise estimates of the ecological parameters and revealed additional occupied sites in areas where the species is likely expanding. Overall, we found that ambiguous data should be considered when studying the distribution of large carnivores through the use of dynamic occupancy models that account for misidentification. Article impact statement: Use of ambiguous detections can improve understanding of large‐carnivore distribution dynamics.

Sin embargo, el monitoreo eficiente de muchas especies de carnívoros mayores es complicada debido a su rareza, comportamiento elusivo y las grandes extensiones de su ámbito de hogar. Su monitoreo puede incluir avistamientos oportunistas por parte de los ciudadanos, además de los censos diseñados. Pueden ocurrir dos tipos de errores de detección en dichos métodos de monitoreo: negativos falsos y negativos positivos. La detección de los falsos negativos puede justificarse en los modelos de distribución de especies (MDE) que manejan la detección imperfecta. La detección de falsos positivos por causa de la identificación errónea rara vez se justifica en los MDE. Los investigadores usan generalmente métodos con filtración de datos ad hoc para descartar las observaciones ambiguas previo al análisis. Estas prácticas pueden descartar información ecológica variable sobre la distribución de una especie. Investigamos los costos y beneficios de la inclusión de tipos de datos que podrían contener falsos positivos en lugar de descartarlos de los MDE para carnívoros mayores. Usamos un modelo dinámico de ocupación que justificó simultáneamente los falsos positivos y falsos negativos para analizar en conjunto los datos que incluían tanto las detecciones no ambiguas como las ambiguas. Usamos simulaciones para comparar el desempeño de nuestro modelo con el de un modelo ajustado solamente para datos no ambiguos. Probamos los dos modelos en cuatro escenarios en los que variaron los parámetros que controlan la detección de falsos positivos y de detecciones verdaderas. Aplicamos nuestro modelo a datos del monitoreo del lince euroasiático (Lynx lynx) en los Alpes. La suma de las detecciones ambiguas incrementó la precisión de las estimaciones de los parámetros. Para el lince euroasiático, la incorporación de las detecciones ambiguas produjo estimaciones más precisas de los parámetros ecológicos y reveló sitios ocupados adicionales en áreas en donde la especie probablemente se esté expandiendo. En general, encontramos que los datos ambiguos deberían ser considerados cuando se estudia la distribución de carnívoros mayores por medio del uso de modelos dinámicos de ocupación que justifican la identificación errónea.

Such models are widely used to infer community dynamics of sessile organisms because transition probabilities (the elements of transition probability matrices) can be estimated with time series data from ""grid sampling,"" where species occupancy states are assessed at multiple fixed points in a quadrat or transect. These estimates, however, are known to be biased when resampling error exists. In this study, we used the perspective of multistate dynamic occupancy models to develop a new Markov model that is structured hierarchically such that transitions among occupancy states and observation processes are considered explicitly at each fixed point. We show that, by adopting a hierarchical Bayesian approach, our model provides estimates for transition probabilities that are robust to sampling error. We also show that error rate may be estimated without additional data obtained from rapid repeated sampling. Considerations for the analysis for the application to real data set and potential extensions of the proposed model are discussed.

While multistate mark–recapture models can produce high‐quality inference, these techniques are difficult to employ at large spatial and long temporal scales or in small remnant host populations decimated by virulent pathogens, where low recapture rates may preclude the use of mark–recapture techniques. Recently developed N‐mixture models offer a statistical framework for estimating wildlife disease dynamics from count data. N‐mixture models are a type of state‐space model in which observation error is attributed to failing to detect some individuals when they are present (i.e., false negatives). The analysis approach uses repeated surveys of sites over a period of population closure to estimate detection probability. We review the challenges of modeling disease dynamics and describe how N‐mixture models can be used to estimate common metrics, including pathogen prevalence, transmission, and recovery rates while accounting for imperfect host and pathogen detection. We also offer a perspective on future research directions at the intersection of quantitative and disease ecology, including the estimation of false positives in pathogen presence, spatially explicit disease‐structured N‐mixture models, and the integration of other data types with count data to inform disease dynamics. Managers rely on accurate and precise estimates of disease dynamics to develop strategies to mitigate pathogen impacts on host populations. At a time when pathogens pose one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, statistical methods that lead to robust inferences on host populations are critically needed for rapid, rather than incremental, assessments of the impacts of emerging infectious diseases. Recently developed unmarked hierarchical models provide a powerful tool that estimates either the same or similar parameters as mark–recapture models while correcting for imperfect host and pathogen detectability. By sampling across space and time, disease ecologists can jointly estimate host and pathogen occupancy (e.g., site‐occupancy models), abundance (e.g., N‐mixture models), or disease dynamics (e.g., dynamic occupancy model or generalized N‐mixture model). We provide a primer and detailed tutorials (step‐by‐step guide and R code) for easy implementation of basic unmarked data models and several extensions.

Pond-breeding amphibians are often touted as a classic example of metapopulation structure. However, empirical assessment of this assumption is lacking for many species owing to the prohibitively high costs of movement studies. Our aim was to use spatially explicit occupancy models to evaluate metapopulation dynamics in an endangered amphibian. First, dynamic, spatially explicit occupancy-based metapopulation models were fitted to 8 years of presence-absence data for the endangered reticulated flatwoods salamander, Ambystoma bishopi. Models were constructed to evaluate the spatial distribution of salamanders across the landscape, rate of patch turnover, and connectivity between patches. Second, the same data were analysed adopting an eigenvector mapping approach and spatial correlograms to investigate habitat characteristics associated with occupancy state. The second approach also yields an independent measure of patch connectivity to corroborate findings from the dynamic model. Both models predicted a steep drop-off in connectivity with increasing isolation, and no evidence was found of interactions between wetlands separated by distances greater than 1.5 km. The best predictor of salamander occupancy status was the amount of understorey vegetation in wetland basins. Taken together, the two modelling approaches provide complementary information regarding the key determinants of occupancy in the focal species. Furthermore, several results directly translate to management recommendations. Connectivity between distant sites is low, and thus management units should be demarcated accordingly. Understorey vegetation represents egg-laying habitat and refugia for larvae, and hence should be targeted in future restoration efforts. The methodologies employed in this paper have broad applicability to studies of pond-breeding amphibians, particularly in situations where direct measures of dispersal are unobtainable.

The model is flexible and can accommodate data from a range of sampling designs that provide information about both occupancy and detection probability. Output from the model can be used to create distribution maps and to estimate indices of temporal range dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by modeling long-term range dynamics of 10 eastern North American birds using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey.

Estimates from three previous studies are used to illustrate the utility of the sensitivity calculations: a joint occupancy model for a prey species, its predators, and habitat used by both; occurrence dynamics from a well-known metapopulation study of three butterfly species; and Golden Eagle occupancy and reproductive dynamics. I show how to deal efficiently with multistate models and how to calculate sensitivities involving derived state variables and lower-level parameters. In addition, I extend methods to incorporate environmental variation by allowing for spatial and temporal variability in transition probabilities. The approach used here is concise and general and can fully account for environmental variability in transition parameters. The methods can be used to improve inferences in occupancy studies by quantifying the effects of underlying parameters, aiding prediction of future system states, and identifying priorities for sampling effort.

However, efficient monitoring of many large carnivore species is challenging due to their rarity, elusive behavior, and large home ranges. Their monitoring can include opportunistic sightings from citizens in addition to designed surveys. Two types of detection errors may occur in such monitoring schemes: false negatives and false positives. False-negative detections can be accounted for in species distribution models (SDMs) that deal with imperfect detection. False-positive detections, due to species misidentification, have rarely been accounted for in SDMs. Generally, researchers use ad hoc data-filtering methods to discard ambiguous observations prior to analysis. These practices may discard valuable ecological information on the distribution of a species. We investigated the costs and benefits of including data types that may include false positives rather than discarding them for SDMs of large carnivores. We used a dynamic occupancy model that simultaneously accounts for false negatives and positives to jointly analyze data that included both unambiguous detections and ambiguous detections. We used simulations to compare the performances of our model with a model fitted on unambiguous data only. We tested the 2 models in 4 scenarios in which parameters that control false-positive detections and true detections varied. We applied our model to data from the monitoring of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in the European Alps. The addition of ambiguous detections increased the precision of parameter estimates. For the Eurasian lynx, incorporating ambiguous detections produced more precise estimates of the ecological parameters and revealed additional occupied sites in areas where the species is likely expanding. Overall, we found that ambiguous data should be considered when studying the distribution of large carnivores through the use of dynamic occupancy models that account for misidentification.

Occupancy probabilities can be used to determine where surveillance should occur. Conversely, knowledge of the certainty of site-level absence is of special interest in situations where the objective is to completely remove populations despite substantial risk of re-invasion. Indeed, the decision to shift from emphasizing control activities over the full range to emphasizing reinvasion prevention, surveillance, and response near the borders, depends on accurate knowledge of absence across space. We used a dynamic occupancy model to monitor changes in the distribution of an invasive species, feral swine (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>), based on camera-trap data collected as part of a management program from June 2014 to January 2016 in San Diego County, California. Site usage of feral swine declined overall. The most informative predictors of site usage were spatial (latitude and longitude). Site-level non-usage rates increased over time and in response to management removal efforts; and site-level usage rates were heavily impacted by having neighboring sites that were used. Combining the detection probability estimated from the occupancy model and Bayes Theorem, we demonstrated how certainty of local (site-level) absence can be estimated iteratively in time in areas with negative surveillance (no detections) data. Our framework provides a means for using management-based surveillance data to quantify certainty of site-level absence of an invasive species, allowing for adaptive prioritization of surveillance and control resources. Our approach is flexible for application to other species and types of surveillance (e.g., track-plates, eDNA).

Occupancy models have arisen as the main tool to reduce effects of limited knowledge about effort in analyses of opportunistic data. These models are generally using long closure periods (e.g., breeding season) for the estimation of probability of detection and occurrence. Here, we use the fact that multiple opportunistic observations in biodiversity databases may be available even within days (e.g., at popular birding localities) to reduce the closure period to 1 day in order to estimate daily occupancies within the breeding season. We use a hierarchical dynamic occupancy model for daily visits to analyze opportunistic observations of 71 species from nine wetlands during 10 years. Our model derives measures of seasonal site use within seasons from estimates of daily occupancy. Comparing results from our 'seasonal site use model' to results from a traditional annual occupancy model (using a closure criterion of 2 months or more) showed that our model provides more detailed biologically relevant information. For example, when the aim is to analyze occurrences of breeding species, an annual occupancy model will over-estimate site use of species with temporary occurrences (e.g., migrants passing by, single itinerary prospecting individuals) as even a single observation during the closure period will be viewed as an occupancy. Alternatively, our model produces estimates of the extent to which sites are actually used. Model validation based on simulated data confirmed that our model is robust to changes and variability in sampling effort and species detectability. We conclude that more information can be gained from opportunistic data with multiple replicates (e.g., several reports per day almost every day) by reducing the time window of the closure criterion to acquire estimates of occupancies within seasons.

Spatially explicit population models provide one solution for simulating the dynamics of species and evaluating alternative management regimes., We used a Bayesian model to investigate wetland occupancy dynamics of the endangered growling grass frog Litoria raniformis at a wastewater treatment plant in southern Victoria, Australia. We coupled prior information from earlier research on this species with our survey data to quantify the effects of patch-scale variables and connectivity on the probabilities of occupancy, population extinction and colonization. Hydroperiods of 13 sites were experimentally enhanced to bolster occupancy rates by L. raniformis. We used simulations to assess the extent to which the enhanced hydroperiod regime improved the viability of the focal metapopulation., Occupancy rate increased by 15% among the enhanced sites in 2013-2014, whereas the rate of occupancy among unenhanced sites fell by 11% in that year. Forward simulation using the dynamic occupancy model suggested that the minimum occupancy rate across the metapopulation would be 18% higher if the enhanced hydroperiod regime was retained over the next 20 years., Mean posterior effects of patch-scale variables and connectivity on the occupancy dynamics of L. raniformis were consistent with the prior effect in all cases, with only small changes to the size of these effects. There was no clear effect of water chemistry on occupancy dynamics., Synthesis and applications. This work suggests that managing the hydroperiod of constructed wetlands can be an effective tool for the conservation of amphibians and demonstrates the utility of spatially explicit models for assessing metapopulation viability. We encourage managers to experimentally test the efficacy of manipulating patch-scale variables to improve occupancy rates within amphibian metapopulations.

Using a before-after control-impact study design, we investigated the effects of urbanization on larval and adult stages of southern two-lined salamanders (Eurycea cirrigera) and northern dusky salamanders (Desmognathus fuscus). Over 5 years, we estimated changes in occupancy and probabilities of colonization and survival in 13 stream catchments after urbanization and in 17 catchments that were not urbanized. We also examined effects of proportion of urbanized area in a catchment and distance of the salamander population to the nearest stream on probabilities of colonization and survival. Before urbanization, adult and larval stages of the two salamander species occupied nearly all surveyed streams, with occupancy estimates ranging from 1.0 to 0.78. Four years after urbanization mean occupancy of larval and adult two-lined salamanders had decreased from 0.87 and 0.78 to 0.57 and 0.39, respectively. Estimates of mean occupancy of larval northern dusky salamanders decreased from 1.0 to 0.57 in urban streams 4 years after urbanization; however, adult northern dusky salamander occupancy remained close to 1.0 in urban streams over 5 years. Occupancy estimates in control streams were similar for each species and stage over 5 years. Urbanization was associated with decreases in survival probabilities of adult and larval two-lined salamanders and decreases in colonization probabilities of larval dusky salamanders. Nevertheless, proportion of impervious surface and distance to nearest stream had little effect on probabilities of survival and colonization. Our results imply that in the evaluation of the effects of urbanization on species, such as amphibians, with complex life cycles, consideration of the effects of urbanization on both adult and larval stages is required.

Recently, there is growing evidence the congeneric invasive barred owl ( Strix varia) may be responsible for the continued decline primarily by excluding spotted owls from their preferred habitat. We used a long-term demographic study for spotted owls in coastal northern California as the basis for a pilot barred owl removal experiment. Our demography study used capture-recapture, reproductive output, and territory occupancy data collected from 1990 to 2013 to evaluate trends in vital rates and populations. We used a classic before-after-control-impact (BACI) experimental design to investigate the demographic response of northern spotted owls to the lethal removal of barred owls. According to the best 2-species dynamic occupancy model, there was no evidence of differences in barred or northern spotted owl occupancy prior to the initiation of the treatment (barred owl removal). After treatment, barred owl occupancy was lower in the treated relative to the untreated areas and spotted owl occupancy was higher relative to the untreated areas. Barred owl removal decreased spotted owl territory extinction rates but did not affect territory colonization rates. As a result, spotted owl occupancy increased in the treated area and continued to decline in the untreated areas. Prior to and after barred owl removal, there was no evidence that average fecundity differed on the 2 study areas. However, the greater number of occupied spotted owl sites on the treated areas resulted in greater productivity in the treated areas based on empirical counts of fledged young. Prior to removal, survival was declining at a rate of approximately 0.2% per year for treated and untreated areas. Following treatment, estimated survival was 0.859 for the treated areas and 0.822 for the untreated areas. Derived estimates of population change on both study areas showed the same general decline before removal with an estimated slope of -0.0036 per year. Following removal, the rate of population change on the treated areas increased to an average of 1.029 but decreased to an average of 0.870 on the untreated areas. The results from this first experiment demonstrated that lethal removal of barred owls allowed the recovery of northern spotted owl populations in the treated portions of our study area. If additional federally funded barred owl removal experiments provide similar results, this could be the foundation for development of a long-term conservation strategy for northern spotted owls. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.

Bailey Keywords: Expert elicitation; extinction risk; host-pathogen dynamics; optimal strategy; metapopulation viability; spatially explicit; structured decision Abstract Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a salient threat to many animal taxa, causing local and global extinctions, altering communities and ecosystem function. The EID chytridiomycosis is a prominent driver of amphibian declines, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). To guide conservation policy, we developed a predictive decision-analytic model that combines empirical knowledge of host-pathogen metapopulation dynamics with expert judgment regarding effects of management actions, to select from potential conservation strategies. We apply our approach to a boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas boreas) and Bd system, identifying optimal strategies that balance tradeoffs in maximizing toad population persistence and landscape-level distribution, while considering costs. The most robust strategy is expected to reduce the decline of toad breeding sites from 53% to 21% over 50 years. Our findings are incorporated into management policy to guide conservation planning. Our online modeling application provides a template for managers of other systems challenged by EIDs. CAPTION(S): Appendix S1.

Two major forms of error exist in occupancy datasets; failing to observe a species when present (imperfect detection—also known as false negatives), and falsely reporting a species as present (false‐positive errors). Estimating these rates allows us to quantify volunteer data quality, and may prevent the inference of erroneous trends. We use a new parameterization of a dynamic occupancy model to estimate and adjust for false‐negative and false‐positive errors, producing accurate estimates of occupancy. We validated this model using simulations and applied it to 12 species datasets collected from a 15‐year, large‐scale volunteer amphibian monitoring program. False‐positive rates were low for most, but not all, species, and accounting for these errors led to quantitative differences in occupancy, although trends remained consistent even when these effects were ignored.

We examined spatial and temporal patterns of range expansion for white-winged doves along the northern edge of their geographical range from 1979 to 2007 and used a dynamic occupancy model to estimate when and where doves would be found along an expansion gradient. Location Southern half of the USA. Methods We modelled spatial variation in the range expansion of white-winged doves from 1979 to 2007 using data from the North American Breeding Bird Surveys ( BBS) and distance from initial population centre, area of urban land cover, and ecoregion. We used a robust design occupancy analysis to estimate species expansion rate based on a model set grounded in broad-scale conditions likely to drive dove distribution. We evaluated our best fitting model (using Akaike's information criterion adjusted for small sample size) by comparing estimates to actual observations in 1993 and 2007 using area under the curve ( AUC) metrics from receiver-operating characteristic plots. Results Our spatial distribution model indicated that range expansion of white-winged doves was primarily influenced by distance from the core population centre, with additive effects of ecoregion and land cover. In 1979, white-winged doves were present in 12% of survey locations, whereas presence increased to 41% by 2007. Across all ecoregions, urban land cover was positively related to probability of occupancy. We evaluated our model for 1993 and 2007 by comparing derived occupancy estimates to sightings of white-winged doves within our sample hexagons using BBS survey data. Based on high AUC statistics (> 0.85), we concluded that our model was useful for accurately predicting range expansion. Main conclusions Estimating occurrence and range expansion of white-winged doves and other expanding/invasive avian species at large spatial scales can be effectively conducted using BBS data. Using these nationwide, long-term survey data to relate expansion to a suite of conditions likely to drive population dynamics is an effective approach to developing predictive models of range expansion.

American Golden-Plovers {Pluvialis dominica) migrate though the Midwestern United States each spring, where most natural hábitat has been converted to row crop agriculture. We investigated the stopover ecology of the golden-plover in the agricultural matrix of east-central Illinois and west-central Indiana between 2008 and 2012. We found that golden-plovers remained in the region for ~45 days and individuals spent on average 24 days in the area before departing to the northwest. During a period of peak migration, golden-plovers preferred fields with standing water and, to a lesser extent, soybean fields. Over the 45-day stopover duration, golden-plovers moved extensively (shown by a dynamic occupancy model and area used estimation), with some evidence for tilled fields becoming unoccupied at greater rates than untilled fields. The tendency to use fields with standing water and the movement of individuals from tilled fields suggests that food accessibility, rather than food abundance, is likely a critical factor associated with the prolonged stay, movement, and field type selection of golden-plovers. Food accessibility is important to the golden-plover because they undergo molt into breeding plumage in the region and must refuel for the next leg of their migration. The Midwest is a key stopover location for American Golden-Plovers and promoting foraging conditions by manipulating the drainage of agricultural fields, via the temporary blockage of drain tiles, should be a management focus.

Pluvialis dominica migra cada primavera a través del medio oeste de los Estados Unidos, donde la mayoría de los hábitats naturales han sido convertidos en áreas agrícolas para cultivos en surco. Investigamos la ecoiogía de las paradas migratorias de Pluvialis dominica en la matriz agrícola del centro-oriente de Illinois y el centro-oeste de Indiana entre 2008 y 2012. Encontramos que P. dominica está presente en la region aproximadamente por 45 días y que los individuos pararon en promedio por 24 días antes de partir al noroeste. Durante el periodo pico de migración, P. dominica prefirió los campos de cultivo con aguas estancadas y, en menor medida, los campos de soya. Durante los 45 días, los individuos se movieron considerablemente (evidenciado a partir de un modelo dinámico de ocupación y de la estimación del área usada) y existe alguna evidencia de que los campos cultivados se desocupan a tasas mayores que los no cultivados. Creemos que la tendencia de usar los campos con aguas estancadas y el movimiento de los individuos desde los campos cultivados sugieren que la accesibilidad al alimento, y no su abundancia, es probablemente un factor crítico asociado con la estadía prolongada, el movimiento y la selección del tipo de campo en P. dominica. Dicha accesibilidad al alimento es importante para P. dominica debido a que los individuos mudan a su plumaje reproductivo en esa region y deben reabastecerse para la siguiente etapa de su migración. El medio oeste de los Estados Unidos es una localidad clave de parada migratoria para P. dominica y el manejo de los campos agrícolas debería enfocarse en la manipulación del drenaje de los mismos por medio del bloqueo temporal de los canales de desagüe para promover las buenas condiciones de alimentación para esta especie.

K. Frey, Adam S. Hadley, Matthew G. Betts, Mark Robertson Keywords: dynamic occupancy models; forest bird distributions; forest structure and composition; microclimate; mountains; within-season movements Abstract Aim Climate changes are anticipated to have pervasive negative effects on biodiversity and are expected to necessitate widespread range shifts or contractions. Such projections are based upon the assumptions that (1) species respond primarily to broad-scale climatic regimes, or (2) that variation in climate at fine spatial scales is less relevant at coarse spatial scales. However, in montane forest landscapes, high degrees of microclimate variability could influence occupancy dynamics and distributions of forest species. Using high-resolution bird survey and under-canopy air temperature data, we tested the hypothesis that the high vagility of most forest bird species combined with the heterogeneous thermal regime of mountain landscapes would enable them to adjust initial settlement decisions to track their thermal niches. Location Western Cascade Mountains, Oregon, USA. Methods We used dynamic occupancy models to test the degree to which microclimate affects the distribution patterns of forest birds in a heterogeneous mountain environment. In all models we statistically accounted for vegetation structure, vegetation composition and potential biases due to imperfect detection of birds. We generated spatial predictions of forest bird distributions in relation to microclimate and vegetation structure. Results Fine-scale temperature metrics were strong predictors of bird distributions; effects of temperature on within-season occupancy dynamics were as large or larger (1-1.7 times) than vegetation effects. Most species (86.7%) exhibited apparent within-season occupancy dynamics. However, species were almost as likely to be warm associated (i.e., apparent settlement at warmer sites and/or vacancy at cooler sites; 53.3% of species) as cool associated (i.e., apparent settlement at cooler sites and/or vacancy at warmer sites; 46.7% of species), suggesting that microclimate preferences are species specific. Main conclusions High-resolution temperature data increase the quality of predictions about avian distribution dynamics and should be included in efforts to project future distributions. We hypothesize that microclimate-associated distribution patterns may reflect species&apos; potential for behavioural buffering from climate change in montane forest environments.

Despite the strong fingerprint of recent historical climate change on species&apos; distributions, biotic factors such as loss of vegetative habitat and the presence of potential competitors constitute important yet often overlooked drivers of range dynamics. Furthermore, short-term changes in environmental conditions can influence the underlying processes of local extinction and local colonization that drive range shifts, yet are rarely considered at broad scales. We used dynamic state-space occupancy models to test multiple hypotheses of the relative importance of major drivers of range shifts of Golden-winged Warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera) and Blue-winged Warblers (V. cyanoptera) between 1983 and 2012 across North America: warming temperatures; habitat changes; and occurrence of congeneric species, used here as proxy for biotic interactions. Dynamic occupancies for both species were most influenced by spatial relative to temporal variation in temperature and habitat. However, temporal variation in temperature anomalies and biotic interactions remained important. The two biotic factors considered, habitat change and biotic interactions, had the largest relative effect on estimated extinction rates followed by abiotic temperature anomalies. For the Golden-winged Warbler, the predicted presence of the Blue-winged Warbler, a hypothesized competitor, most influenced extinction probabilities, contributing to evidence supporting its role in site-level species replacement. Given the overall importance of biotic factors on range-wide dynamic occupancies, their consideration alongside abiotic factors should not be overlooked. Our results suggest that warming compounds the negative effect of habitat loss emphasizing species&apos; need for habitat to adapt to a changing climate. Notably, even closely related species exhibited individual responses to abiotic and biotic factors considered. CAPTION(S): Table S1.

We evaluated the sampling properties of estimators of these parameters using simulated data across a range of the parameters, differing levels of sites and visits, with a published dynamic occupancy model (Royle and Kery 2007).

Two major forms of error exist in occupancy datasets; failing to observe a species when present (imperfect detection—also known as false negatives), and falsely reporting a species as present (false‐positive errors). Estimating these rates allows us to quantify volunteer data quality, and may prevent the inference of erroneous trends. We use a new parameterization of a dynamic occupancy model to estimate and adjust for false‐negative and false‐positive errors, producing accurate estimates of occupancy. We validated this model using simulations and applied it to 12 species datasets collected from a 15‐year, large‐scale volunteer amphibian monitoring program. False‐positive rates were low for most, but not all, species, and accounting for these errors led to quantitative differences in occupancy, although trends remained consistent even when these effects were ignored.

Other facets of diversity such as functional diversity are also rarely explored. We investigated the avian diversity-landscape heterogeneity relationship in agricultural landscapes by considering two aspects of diversity: taxonomic diversity (species richness) estimated from a multi-species dynamic occupancy model, and functional diversity (functional evenness [FEve] and divergence [FDiv]) based on traits of occurring species. We also assessed how agricultural lands enrolled in a conservation program managed on behalf of declining early successional bird species (hereafter CP38 fields, an agri-environment scheme) influenced avian diversity. We analyzed breeding bird data collected at CP38 fields in Mississippi, USA, during 2010-2012, and two principal components of environmental variables: a gradient of heterogeneity (Shannon's landscape diversity index) and of the amount of CP38 fields (percent cover of CP38 fields; CP38). FEve did not show significant responses to environmental variables, whereas FDiv responded positively to heterogeneity and negatively to CP38. However, most FDiv values did not significantly differ from random expectations along an environmental gradient. When there was a significant difference, FDiv was lower than that expected. Unlike functional diversity, species richness showed a clear pattern. Species richness increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity but decreased with increasing amounts of CP38 fields. Only one species responded negatively to heterogeneity and positively to CP38. Our results suggest that the relationships between avian diversity and landscape heterogeneity may vary depending on the aspect of diversity considered: strong positive effects of heterogeneity on taxonomic diversity, but weakly positive or non-significant effects on functional diversity. Our results also indicate that effectiveness of CP38 in conserving avian diversity, particularly, taxonomic diversity, could be limited without the consideration of landscape heterogeneity.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsdoj&AN=edsdoj.b563255e037542baa50611613d3ee8d9&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

The effect of survey effort on species detection has long been appreciated and Atlases typically include survey standards and records of effort, but challenges remain in analysing Atlas data that have not been collected using a repeated sampling protocol designed to correct for imperfect detection. We developed a singleâvisit dynamic occupancy model to quantify the effects of climatic and landâuse drivers on local species extinction and colonization while accounting for imperfect detection using repeat Atlas data. We evaluated model stability using data simulated under alternative scenarios and, ultimately, applied the model to empirical data for Canada warbler Cardellina canadensis, a wideâspread species exhibiting a longâterm population decline. At sample sizes that are realistic for many Atlases (nÂ =Â 1000â10Â 000 independent survey blocks), our models produced unbiased estimates of detection, occupancy, colonization and extinction parameters. Slope estimates for explanatory covariates were somewhat less stable than overall occupancy, colonization and extinction rates, with covariate effects being sensitive to the total number of, and relationships among, explanatory variables. In comparison to other analyses of Canada warbler distributions that indicated minor changes over time, our approach identified a widespread decline in occupancy probability across New York, consistent with the broader population trend, particularly in the areas where it was initially more likely to occur. Synthesis and applications. A singleâvisit dynamic occupancy model is a novel method for analysing common, ecologically valuable datasets, such as Atlases, that lack repeated sampling necessary to correct for imperfect detection using alternative multiâseason occupancy modelling approaches. As a result, using this method can improve understanding of species distributions and factors that shape them over time, thereby providing more accurate information to guide conservation and management.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=agr&AN=IND605863186&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

While citizen science data sets can be large, on a regional and local scale, they are often undervalued but present an opportunity for managers to inform their decisions if the missing data can be addressed. To overcome this hurdle, here, missing values were modeled with a combination of spatial (inverse distance weighting and spatial stream network), temporal (Bayesian state space), and machine learning (ensemble random forest) models combining atmospheric, hydrologic, and biologic data. Using the estimated missing values, we determined negative population trends in stoneflies driven by stream temperature via a dynamic occupancy model. Urban streams present a challenge to resource managers because data are collected at disparate locations and frequencies and inconsistently recorded.

Both invasive taxa are implicated in declines of native amphibians in this region, but few long‐term studies of communities exist. Further, field studies of invasive–native interactions are complicated by confounding habitat modifications and observation errors. We surveyed amphibians and measured habitat characteristics for 12 yr across 38 wetland sites within the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. We assessed the influence of invasive species, habitat, and their interactions on the distributions of five native amphibian species using a multispecies dynamic occupancy model that accounted for false‐negative and false‐positive detections. In general, habitat characteristics—such as within‐pond vegetation cover, surrounding forest, and drought severity—were important for local persistence of native species when bullfrogs co‐occurred. We also found evidence of a cumulative negative effect of bullfrogs and non‐native fish (families Centrarchidae and Ictaluridae) on northern red‐legged frog (Rana aurora) local persistence that was mediated by the dominance of invasive reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea). Non‐native fish and bullfrogs had variable effects on native amphibian species, but neither invasive taxon appears to be causing declines in occupied sites within our study area. Moreover, species relationships with habitat differed when invaders were present, indicating that certain habitats may increase persistence of native amphibians in the invaded landscape.

An important component of adaptive management is identifying clear, measurable conservation objectives that reflect the desired outcomes of stakeholders. A common objective is to have a sustainable population, or metapopulation, but it can be difficult to quantify a threshold above which such a population is likely to persist. We performed a Bayesian metapopulation viability analysis (BMPVA) using a dynamic occupancy model to quantify the characteristics of two wood frog (Lithobates sylvatica) metapopulations resulting in sustainable populations, and we demonstrate how the results could be used to define meaningful objectives that serve as the basis of adaptive management. We explored scenarios involving metapopulations with different numbers of patches (pools) using estimates of breeding occurrence and successful metamorphosis from two study areas to estimate the probability of quasi-extinction and calculate the proportion of vernal pools producing metamorphs. Our results suggest that ≥50 pools are required to ensure long-term persistence with approximately 16% of pools producing metamorphs in stable metapopulations. We demonstrate one way to incorporate the BMPVA results into a utility function that balances the trade-offs between ecological and financial objectives, which can be used in an adaptive management framework to make optimal, transparent decisions.

Location New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Methods We used data on koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) presence and absence collected across the state of NSW from public surveys between 1987 and 2011. A dynamic occupancy model was built to quantify the role of climate and land use change on koala extinction risk and occupancy. We contrasted the model results against the more usual static occupancy model approach. We then developed scenarios of future climate, land clearing and urbanization and predicted the distribution of the koalas over the next 20 years based on the dynamic occupancy model. Results The static model indicates koala occupancy in 1987 and in 2011 depended most strongly on annual rainfall and distance to water features. Housing density and its interaction with Eucalyptus forest cover only minimally affected koala occupancy. However, for the dynamic occupancy model, extinction risk (the metric of dominant concern for species conservation) depended most strongly on Eucalyptus forest cover and its interaction with housing density, while annual rainfall only minimally affected extinction risk. We predicted extinction risk to be higher in western NSW than in the east and that extinction risk may increase under future scenarios of climate and land use change. Main conclusions This study underlines the importance of incorporating extinction dynamics when modelling species distributional shifts under climate and land use change and we provide an approach for doing so using public-based surveys. As conservation objectives usually aim to maximize persistence, this is likely to lead to more reliable identification of conservation priorities than using static species distribution models. Combining public-based surveys and dynamic occupancy models provides a powerful approach for achieving this across broad spatial extents, thus providing an alternative approach when field-based data collection is impractical.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.24033243&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

Recently, there is growing evidence the congeneric invasive barred owl {Strix varia) may be responsible for the continued decline primarily by excluding spotted owls from their preferred habitat. We used a long-term demographic study for spotted owls in coastal northern California as the basis for a pilot barred owl removal experiment. Our demography study used capture–recapture, reproductive output, and territory occupancy data collected from 1990 to 2013 to evaluate trends in vital rates and populations. We used a classic before-after-control-impact (BACI) experimental design to investigate the demographic response of northern spotted owls to the lethal removal of barred owls. According to the best 2-species dynamic occupancy model, there was no evidence of differences in barred or northern spotted owl occupancy prior to the initiation of the treatment (barred owl removal). After treatment, barred owl occupancy was lower in the treated relative to the untreated areas and spotted owl occupancy was higher relative to the untreated areas. Barred owl removal decreased spotted owl territory extinction rates but did not affect territory colonization rates. As a result, spotted owl occupancy increased in the treated area and continued to decline in the untreated areas. Prior to and after barred owl removal, there was no evidence that average fecundity differed on the 2 study areas. However, the greater number of occupied spotted owl sites on the treated areas resulted in greater productivity in the treated areas based on empirical counts of fledged young. Prior to removal, survival was declining at a rate of approximately 0.2% per year for treated and untreated areas. Following treatment, estimated survival was 0.859 for the treated areas and 0.822 for the untreated areas. Derived estimates of population change on both study areas showed the same general decline before removal with an estimated slope of−0.0036 per year. Following removal, the rate of population change on the treated areas increased to an average of 1.029 but decreased to an average of 0.870 on the untreated areas. The results from this first experiment demonstrated that lethal removal of barred owls allowed the recovery of northern spotted owl populations in the treated portions of our study area. If additional federally funded barred owl removal experiments provide similar results, this could be the foundation for development of a long-term conservation strategy for northern spotted owls.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.24765001&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

However, few versions of the model relate these probabilities to the occupancies of neighboring sites or patches. We present a modeling framework that incorporates this information and is capable of describing a wide variety of spatiotemporal colonization and extinction processes. A key feature of the model is that it is based on a simple set of small-scale rules describing how the process evolves. The result is a dynamic process that can account for complicated large-scale features. In our model, a site is more likely to be colonized if more of its neighbors were previously occupied and if it provides more appealing environmental characteristics than its neighboring sites. Additionally, a site without occupied neighbors may also become colonized through the inclusion of a long-distance dispersal process. Although similar model specifications have been developed for epidemiological applications, ours formally accounts for detectability using the well-known occupancy modeling framework. After demonstrating the viability and potential of this new form of dynamic occupancy model in a simulation study, we use it to obtain inference for the ongoing Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis) invasion in South Africa. Our results suggest that the Common Myna continues to enlarge its distribution and its spread via short distance movement, rather than long-distance dispersal. Overall, this new modeling framework provides a powerful tool for managers examining the drivers of colonization including short- vs. long-distance dispersal, habitat quality, and distance from source populations.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.24703005&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"
"Assessing spatio-temporal priorities for species' recovery in broad-scale dynamic landscapes","Truly Santika; Clive A. McAlpine; Daniel Lunney; Kerrie A. Wilson; Jonathan R.

As threats to biodiversity from environmental change increase, assessing priorities for mitigation action becomes increasingly important. However, there have been few attempts to schedule actions across broad spatial extents that explicitly account for dynamic ecological processes and threats. 2. We combined a dynamic occupancy model with a decision analysis framework to spatially allocate multiple recovery actions to maximize species' probability of occupancy under threats posed by climate and land-use change. We used the koala Phascolarctos cinereus across the Australian state of New South Wales (810 000 km²) to illustrate this approach. We considered four actions implemented on a 10 × 10 km² grid: reduce domestic dog attacks through dog control, reduce vehicle collisions through fencing highways, protect habitat through land acquisitions and restore Eucalyptus forest. We used the occupancy model to predict ecological responses to recovery actions and simulated annealing to identify spatio-temporal priorities for each action. We contrasted the results against priorities generated using a traditional static distribution model. 3. To maximize the probability of koala occupancy in 50 years' time, with an annual budget of up to AU$20 million, investment priorities were located in the eastern part of koala's range, focusing on dog control with some investment in habitat protection and restoration. With higher budgets, investment priorities shifted towards habitat protection and restoration in the western part of the range. However, priorities based on the static distribution model, which had a lower predictive accuracy than the dynamic model, were different. Regardless of budget, priorities derived from the static model were predominantly located in the western part of koala's range, focusing on highway fencing with some investment in dog control. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our approach for integrating spatio-temporal dynamics into conservation prioritization across broad spatial extents provides a significant advance on existing approaches based on static distribution models. The finding that the inferior static model produced different priorities to the dynamic model cautions against the use of static models for conservation planning in dynamic landscapes. Additionally, the substantial changes in priorities with budget indicate that conservation planning under dynamic landscape and climate change must carefully consider priority actions and locations relative to the conservation resources available.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.43869255&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

We examined spatial and temporal patterns of range expansion for white-winged doves along the northern edge of their geographical range from 1979 to 2007 and used a dynamic occupancy model to estimate when and where doves would be found along an expansion gradient. Location Southern half of the USA. Methods We modelled spatial variation in the range expansion of white-winged doves from 1979 to 2007 using data from the North American Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS) and distance from initial population centre, area of urban land cover, and ecoregion. We used a robust design occupancy analysis to estimate species expansion rate based on a model set grounded in broadscale conditions likely to drive dove distribution. We evaluated our best fitting model (using Akaike's information criterion adjusted for small sample size) by comparing estimates to actual observations in 1993 and 2007 using area under the curve (AUC) metrics from receiver-operating characteristic plots. Results Our spatial distribution model indicated that range expansion of white-winged doves was primarily influenced by distance from the core population centre, with additive effects of ecoregion and land cover. In 1979, white-winged doves were present in 12% of survey locations, whereas presence increased to 41% by 2007. Across all ecoregions, urban land cover was positively related to probability of occupancy. We evaluated our model for 1993 and 2007 by comparing derived occupancy estimates to sightings of white-winged doves within our sample hexagons using BBS survey data. Based on high AUC statistics (> 0.85), we concluded that our model was useful for accurately predicting range expansion. Main conclusions Estimating occurrence and range expansion of white-winged doves and other expanding/invasive avian species at large spatial scales can be effectively conducted using BBS data. Using these nationwide, long-term survey data to relate expansion to a suite of conditions likely to drive population dynamics is an effective approach to developing predictive models of range expansion.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=sso&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.24035513&site=eds-live&scope=site&custid=s2775460"

This method can be extended, given multiple survey periods, to permit the estimation of seasonal probabilities of ψ, colonization (γ), persistence (φ), and extinction (1 — φ) in season t. We evaluated the sampling properties of estimators of these parameters using simulated data across a range of the parameters, differing levels of sites and visits, with a published dynamic occupancy model (Royle and Kery 2007). Bias depended largely on p and the number of visits, but also on the number of sites, ψ t , γ, and 1 — φ. To decrease bias in all parameters to near zero, our results suggest that the number of required visits will depend on p, such that the probability of detection at an occupied site is near 0.9, and the required number of sites will be near 60 for ψ t estimation and 120 or greater for γ and 1 — φ estimation.

We found two non-connected core areas of occupancy, one in the west and the other in the centre of the Pyrenees, with a significant decrease in habitat use overall during 2008–2014. We also found a negative correlation between human density and bear occupancy, in agreement with previous studies on brown bear habitat suitability.
