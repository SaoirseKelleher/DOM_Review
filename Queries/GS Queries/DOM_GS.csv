However, as interacting species (e.g., predators and prey) often operate at different spatial scales, including nested spatial structure might be especially relevant in models of interacting species. Here we bridge these two model frameworks by developing a multi-scale two-species occupancy model. The model is dynamic, i.e. it estimates initial occupancy, colonization and extinction probabilities - including probabilities conditional to the other species’ presence. With a simulation study, we demonstrate that the model is able to estimate parameters without bias under low, medium and high average occupancy probabilities, as well as low, medium and high detection probabilities. We further show the model’s ability to deal with sparse field data by applying it to a multi-scale camera trapping dataset on a mustelid-rodent predator-prey system. The field study illustrates that the model allows estimation of species interaction effects on colonization and extinction probabilities at two spatial scales. This creates opportunities to explicitly account for the spatial structure found in many spatially nested study designs, and to study interacting species that have contrasted movement ranges with camera traps.","2020-12-16","2021-10-27 00:46:34","2021-10-27 00:46:34","2021-10-27 00:46:34","","","","","","","","","","","","Ecology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.12.16.423067","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/AXE6RJPN/Kleiven et al. - 2020 - A dynamic occupancy model for interacting species .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper describes a class of hierarchical models parameterized by neural networks: neural hierarchical models. The derivation of such models analogizes the relationship between regression and neural networks. A case study is developed for a neural dynamic occupancy model of North American bird populations, trained on millions of detection/non-detection time series for hundreds of species, providing insights into colonization and extinction at a continental scale. Flexible models are increasingly needed that scale to large data and represent ecological processes. Neural hierarchical models satisfy this need, providing a bridge between deep learning and ecological modeling that combines the function representation power of neural networks with the inferential capacity of hierarchical models.","","2021-10-27 00:46:42","2021-10-27 00:46:42","","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/L3D9WR2M/Joseph - Neural hierarchical models of ecological populatio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is imperative to reliably identify factors that limit connectivity across heterogeneous, fragmented landscapes. Viewing connectivity as the persistence of movement in space from source to destination—along potential corridors simulated from correlated random walks—we adapt the dynamic occupancy modeling framework to present an approach to reliably quantify connectivity. This approach allowed us to estimate the probability of spatial persistence of movement along potential corridors, while accounting for imperfect detec­ tion of animal use of the matrix. We use simulations to test our model, and data from sign surveys of Asian elephant Elephas maximus space use in Garo Hills, Northeast India, as a practical application of the method. Distance to forests and ruggedness predominantly shaped elephant connectivity patterns. Negative effects of distance to forests were intensified at the onset of dispersal, and in the more disturbed part of our landscape. We mapped locations critical to maintaining connectivity in our study landscape. We demonstrate that the widely used occupancy modeling approach, when combined with appropriate field data collection, permits explicit assessment of matrix impacts on connectivity while accounting for imperfect detection of animal movement. In so doing, we highlight the value of the approach in enabling inference on where animals move, as well as why. Obtaining a reliable understanding of factors shaping connectivity is central to understanding and predicting species responses to environmental change, thereby facilitating effective long-term conservation in fragmented landscapes.","2021-01","2021-10-27 00:46:49","2021-10-27 00:46:49","2021-10-27 00:46:49","108874","","","253","","Biological Conservation","Detecting dispersal","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/LGM3YAGQ/Vasudev et al. - 2021 - Detecting dispersal A spatial dynamic occupancy m.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite considerable evidence that demographic rates and dispersal patterns vary temporally in response to an array of biotic and abiotic processes, few applications of metapopulation theory have sought to explore factors that explain spatiotemporal variation in extinction or colonization rates. To facilitate exploring these factors, we extended a spatially explicit model of metapopulation dynamics to create a framework that requires only binary presence–absence data, makes few assumptions about the dispersal process, and accounts for imperfect detection. We apply this framework to 22 yr of biannual survey data for lowland leopard frogs, Lithobates yavapaiensis, an amphibian that inhabits arid stream systems in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for factors that govern temporal variation in transition probabilities, as both extinction and colonization rates varied with hydrologic conditions. Specifically, local extinctions were more frequent during drought periods, particularly at sites without reliable surface water. Colonization rates increased when larval and dispersal periods were wetter than normal, which increased the probability that potential emigrants metamorphosed and reached neighboring sites. Extirpation of frogs from all sites in one watershed during a period of severe drought demonstrated the influence of site-level features, as frogs persisted only in areas where most sites held water consistently and where the amount of sediment deposited from high-elevation wildfires was low. Application of our model provided novel insights into how climaterelated processes affected the distribution and population dynamics of an arid-land amphibian. The approach we describe has application to a wide array of species that inhabit patchy environments, can improve our understanding of factors that govern metapopulation dynamics, and can inform strategies for conservation of imperiled species.","2019-04","2021-10-27 00:46:53","2021-10-27 00:46:53","2021-10-27 00:46:53","","","3","29","","Ecol Appl","Drought‐mediated extinction of an arid‐land amphibian","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/AHTAKD5Z/Zylstra et al. - 2019 - Drought‐mediated extinction of an arid‐land amphib.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While citizen science data sets can be large, on a regional and local scale, they are often undervalued but present an opportunity for managers to inform their decisions if the missing data can be addressed. To overcome this hurdle, here, missing values were modeled with a combination of spatial (inverse distance weighting and spatial stream network), temporal (Bayesian state space), and machine learning (ensemble random forest) models combining atmospheric, hydrologic, and biologic data. Using the estimated missing values, we determined negative population trends in stoneﬂies driven by stream temperature via a dynamic occupancy model. Urban streams present a challenge to resource managers because data are collected at disparate locations and frequencies and inconsistently recorded.

However, few versions of the model relate these probabilities to the occupancies of neighboring sites or patches. We present a modeling framework that incorporates this information and is capable of describing a wide variety of spatiotemporal colonization and extinction processes. A key feature of the model is that it is based on a simple set of small-scale rules describing how the process evolves. The result is a dynamic process that can account for complicated large-scale features. In our model, a site is more likely to be colonized if more of its neighbors were previously occupied and if it provides more appealing environmental characteristics than its neighboring sites. Additionally, a site without occupied neighbors may also become colonized through the inclusion of a long-distance dispersal process. Although similar model speciﬁcations have been developed for epidemiological applications, ours formally accounts for detectability using the well-known occupancy modeling framework. After demonstrating the viability and potential of this new form of dynamic occupancy model in a simulation study, we use it to obtain inference for the ongoing Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis) invasion in South Africa. Our results suggest that the Common Myna continues to enlarge its distribution and its spread via short distance movement, rather than long-distance dispersal. Overall, this new modeling framework provides a powerful tool for managers examining the drivers of colonization including short- vs. long-distance dispersal, habitat quality, and distance from source populations.","2016-01","2021-10-27 00:52:57","2021-10-27 00:52:58","2021-10-27 00:52:57","194-204","","1","97","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/MK2QSL5V/Broms et al. - 2016 - Dynamic occupancy models for explicit colonization.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed spatial and temporal partitioning in martens and fishers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA, using camera trap data collected during winter 2013–2015. To investigate spatial segregation, we used a dynamic occupancy model to estimate species’ occupancy probabilities and probabilities of persistence and colonization as a function of covariates and yearly occupancy probability for the other species. Temporal segregation was assessed by estimating diel activity overlap between species. We found weak evidence of spatial or temporal niche partitioning of martens and fishers. There was high overlap in forest cover selection, and both marten and fisher occupancy were positively correlated with deciduous forests (excluding aspen [Populus tremuloides]). There was strong temporal overlap (Δ̂ 4 = 0.81; CI = 0.79–0.82) with both species exhibiting largely crepuscular activity patterns.

While these techniques provide a useful starting point, they may require many parameters to estimate and are not well suited for making predictions. Here, we present a technique that uses Fourier series to estimate periodic signals in dynamic occupancy models, and parameterize these models with data from a large-scale long-term camera trapping study of medium to large mammals in Chicago, Illinois, USA. Our periodic models captured up to 75% of the temporal variability in species colonization rates and performed similar to dynamic occupancy models with temporally varying parameters. Overall, this method can partition variability between periodic and non-periodic sources and estimate the proportion of temporal variability that is attributable to a periodic source in a model-based framework. Further, practitioners can use this method to incorporate prior knowledge on a species’ natural history (e.g., natal dispersal and migration).

In particular, occupancy-based methods are often recommended for monitoring species, allowing researchers to track population trends using detection–non-detection data alone. Occupancy models, however, have proven difﬁcult to apply to rare, highly mobile species. Species’ movements outside of sampling areas may lead to violation of the geographic closure assumption of occupancy models and overestimated occupancy probability. Low detection probability may further inﬂate occupancy probability estimates. We developed a novel continuous-time, multi-scale occupancy model to simultaneously account for closure assumption violations and low detection probability. We used a simulation study to test our model relative to a discrete-time multi-scale model, and we conducted a power analysis to assess the ability of an instantaneous occupancy parameter to detect trends in abundance, relative to standard occupancy alone. The continuous-time model was competitive with the discrete-time model and was generally computationally faster than and outperformed the discrete-time model when detection probability was low. The instantaneous occupancy parameter outperformed occupancy in terms of power to detect trends when we used an implicit (i.e., estimating occupancy independently in each primary occasion) dynamic occupancy model, but performed no better when we used an explicit (i.e., estimating colonization and extinction) dynamic occupancy model. We applied both discrete-time and continuous-time multi-scale occupancy models to a case study of data collected on wolverines (Gulo gulo) in Washington, USA. We found improved precision in estimates with the continuous-time model and that asymptotic occupancy of wolverines was high, but short-term use of any given area was low. Our multi-scale, continuous-time occupancy model can be used to detect trends in abundance of rare, highly mobile species, regardless of how occupancy dynamics are modeled. Furthermore, our model can allow for more efﬁcient data collection and analysis than traditional discrete-time or spatially multi-scale approaches, as our model uses all available detections and requires only one detector per sampling unit by substituting time for space.","2021-07","2021-10-27 00:53:06","2021-10-27 00:53:06","2021-10-27 00:53:06","","","7","12","","Ecosphere","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/AQWSZ6ZI/Emmet et al. - 2021 - Modeling multi‐scale occupancy for monitoring rare.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated the sampling properties of estimators of these parameters using simulated data across a range of the parameters, differing levels of sites and visits, with a published dynamic occupancy model (Royle and Kery 2007). Bias depended largely on p and the number of visits, but also on the number of sites, ct, g, and 1 À w. To decrease bias in all parameters to near zero, our results suggest that the number of required visits will depend on p, such that the probability of detection at an occupied site is near 0.9, and the required number of sites will be near 60 for ct estimation and 120 or greater for g and 1 À w estimation.

Challenges for designing surveys using the dynamic occupancy modeling framework include defining appropriate derived trend parameters, and providing usable tools for researchers to conduct project-specific sample size investigations. We present a simulation-based power analysis framework for dynamic occupancy models that allows for the incorporation of the underlying environmental space (i.e., as covariates) within a specific study region to inform sample size estimation. We investigate two definitions of temporal trend: (1) a gradual, sustained (linear or nonlinear) change over a period of many years, and (2) an abrupt increase or decrease between two time periods. We draw upon pilot data collected following NABat protocols to inform assumed data generating values in a demonstration of our approach. Due to the complicated parameter structure of dynamic occupancy models, we emphasize the importance of visualizing simulated changes over time based on different parameter settings prior to conducting a power analysis. Our simulations revealed that the linearity of short-term trends (five years in our investigation) conferred higher power with lower sample size than longer trends where occupancy probabilities approached zero (ten years in our investigation). We provide an example of how to use our tools to conduct customized investigations using questions posed by NABat, and in doing so, we shed light on general guidelines that can be applied to programs monitoring species occupancy for other taxa. Importantly, we created an R package to execute our approach for informing program-, species-, and study-specific investigations aimed at identifying changes in species occupancy.","2019-10","2021-10-27 01:00:34","2021-10-27 01:00:34","2021-10-27 01:00:34","166-176","","","105","","Ecological Indicators","Statistical power of dynamic occupancy models to identify temporal change","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/WH5RCLE5/Banner et al. - 2019 - Statistical power of dynamic occupancy models to i.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These estimates, however, are known to be biased when resampling error exists. In this study, we used the perspective of multistate dynamic occupancy models to develop a new Markov model that is structured hierarchically such that transitions among occupancy states and observation processes are considered explicitly at each ﬁxed point. We show that, by adopting a hierarchical Bayesian approach, our model provides estimates for transition probabilities that are robust to sampling error.

Estimating these rates allows us to quantify volunteer data quality, and may prevent the inference of erroneous trends. We use a new parameterization of a dynamic occupancy model to estimate and adjust for false-negative and false-positive errors, producing accurate estimates of occupancy. We validated this model using simulations and applied it to 12 species datasets collected from a 15-year, large-scale volunteer amphibian monitoring program. False-positive rates were low for most, but not all, species, and accounting for these errors led to quantitative differences in occupancy, although trends remained consistent even when these effects were ignored. We present a model that represents an intuitive way of quantifying the quality of volunteer monitoring datasets, and which can produce unbiased estimates of occupancy despite the presence of multiple types of observation error.

We used dynamic occupancy models, which allow the territory-specific extinction and colonization parameters – the demographic rates (at the territory level) underlying a population trend –to be estimated. The Swiss peregrine population has developed in line with trends observed in many other countries and regions in North America and Europe: after the pesticide-induced collapse between the 1950s and 1970s, the population largely recovered up to the turn of the millennium. However, in recent years, we detected significant declines again: in SW Switzerland, the population decreased from 51 to 33 pairs during 2008–2015 (-35%), in the N Jura from 70 to 40 pairs during 2009–2015 (-43%) and in Zurich from 6–7 to 2–4 pairs during 2010–2015 (-50%). In the same time, the local extinction rate in the three study areas (more than) doubled from (0.05) 0.1 to 0.2, while the colonization rate dropped from 0.3 to 0.1 in one of the areas, while no change was detectable in the other two. We discuss two factors responsible for these strong, recent declines of Swiss peregrines: (1) predation by Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo) and (2) direct and illegal persecution by humans.

However, efficient monitoring of many large carnivore species is challenging due to their rarity, elusive behavior, and large home ranges. Their monitoring can include opportunistic sightings from citizens in addition to designed surveys. Two types of detection errors may occur in such monitoring schemes: false negatives and false positives. False-negative detections can be accounted for in species distribution models (SDMs) that deal with imperfect detection. False-positive detections, due to species misidentification, have rarely been accounted for in SDMs. Generally, researchers use ad hoc data-filtering methods to discard ambiguous observations prior to analysis. These practices may discard valuable ecological information on the distribution of a species. We investigated the costs and benefits of including data types that may include false positives rather than discarding them for SDMs of large carnivores. We used a dynamic occupancy model that simultaneously accounts for false negatives and positives to jointly analyze data that included both unambiguous detections and ambiguous detections. We used simulations to compare the performances of our model with a model fitted on unambiguous data only. We tested the 2 models in 4 scenarios in which parameters that control false-positive detections and true detections varied. We applied our model to data from the monitoring of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in the European Alps. The addition of ambiguous detections increased the precision of parameter estimates. For the Eurasian lynx, incorporating ambiguous detections produced more precise estimates of the ecological parameters and revealed additional occupied sites in areas where the species is likely expanding. Overall, we found that ambiguous data should be considered when studying the distribution of large carnivores through the use of dynamic occupancy models that account for misidentification.","2019-02","2021-10-27 01:00:52","2021-10-27 01:00:52","2021-10-27 01:00:52","185-195","","1","33","","Conservation Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/7CKH44UC/Louvrier et al. - 2019 - Use of ambiguous detections to improve estimates f.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This can result in underestimates of occupancy, where nondetection is conflated with absence. The site occupancy model (SOM) overcomes this failure by treating occupancy as a latent variable of the model and incorporates a detection submodel to account for variability in detection rates. These have rarely been applied in the context of marine fish and never for the multiseason dynamic occupancy model (DOM). In this study, a DOM is developed for a designated species of concern, cusk (Brosme brosme), over a four-season period. Making novel use of a highresolution 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model, detectability of cusk is considered as a function of current speed and algae cover. Algal cover on the seabed is measured from video surveys to divide the study area into two distinct regions: those with canopy forming species of algae and those without (henceforth bottom types). Modeled estimates of the proportion of sites occupied in each season are 0.88, 0.45, 0.74, and 0.83. These are significantly greater than the proportion of occupied sites measured from underwater video observations which are 0.57, 0.28, 0.43, and 0.57. Individual fish are detected more frequently with increasing current speed in areas lacking canopy and less frequently with increasing current speed in areas with canopy. The results indicate that, where possible, SDM studies for all marine species should take account of detectability to avoid underestimating the proportion of sites occupied at a given study area. Sampling closed areas or areas of conservation often requires the use of nonphysical, low impact sampling methods like camera surveys. These methods inherently result in detection probabilities less than one, an issue compounded by time-varying features of the environment that are rarely accounted for marine studies. This work highlights the use of modeled hydrodynamics as a tool to correct some of this imbalance.","2018-10","2021-10-27 01:05:12","2021-10-27 01:05:12","2021-10-27 01:05:12","10192-10205","","20","8","","Ecol Evol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/RCCEJUEV/Calvert et al. - 2018 - Dynamic occupancy modeling of temperate marine fis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, seasonal dynamics may influence bird communities differently in different habitat types and therefore seasonal effects should be considered in comparisons. To address these issues, we incorporated seasonal effects and factors potentially affecting bird detectability into models to compare avian community composition and dynamics between coffee agroforests and secondary forest fragments. In particular, we modeled community composition and community dynamics of bird functional groups based on habitat type (coffee agroforest vs. secondary forest) and season while accounting for variation in capture probability (i.e. detectability). The models we used estimated capture probability to be similar between habitat types for each dietary guild, but omnivores had a lower capture probability than frugivores and insectivores. Although apparent species richness was higher in coffee agroforest than secondary forest, model results indicated that omnivores and insectivores were more common in secondary forest when accounting for heterogeneity in capture probability. Our results largely support the notion that shade-coffee can serve as a surrogate habitat for secondary forest with respect to avian communities. Small coffee agroforests embedded within the typical tropical countryside matrix of secondary forest patches and small-scale agriculture, therefore, may host avian communities that resemble those of surrounding secondary forest, and may serve as viable corridors linking patches of forest within these landscapes. This information is an important step toward effective landscape-scale conservation in Neotropical agricultural landscapes.","2013-09-18","2021-10-27 01:05:21","2021-10-27 01:05:21","2021-10-27 01:05:21","e65101","","9","8","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/XILMYCRQ/Hernandez et al. - 2013 - Coffee Agroforests Remain Beneficial for Neotropic.pdf","","","","Krkosek, Martin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, efficient monitoring of many large carnivore species is challenging due to their rarity, elusive behavior and large home range size. In Europe, most current monitoring protocols rely on multiple detection methods, which can include opportunistic sightings from citizens in addition to designed surveys. Two types of detection errors may occur in such monitoring schemes; false negatives and false positives. When not accounted for, both can bias estimates from species distribution models (SDMs). False negative detections can be accounted for in SDMs that deal with imperfect detection. In contrast, false positive detections, due to species misidentification, have only rarely been accounted for in SDMs. Generally, researchers use ad hoc methods to avoid false positives through data filtering to discard ambiguous observations prior to analysis. These practices may discard valuable ecological information on the distribution of a species. Here, we investigated the costs and benefits of including data types that might include false positives rather than discard them for SDMs of large carnivores. We showcase a dynamic occupancy model that simultaneously accounts for false negatives and positives to jointly analyze data that include both unambiguous detections and ambiguous detections. Using simulations, we show that the addition of ambiguous detections increases the precision of parameter estimates. The analysis of data on the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) suggested that incorporating ambiguous detections produced more precise estimates of the ecological parameters and revealed additional occupied sites in areas where the species is likely expanding. Overall, our work shows that ambiguous data should be considered when studying the distribution of large carnivores, through the use of dynamic occupancy models accounting for misidentification.","2019-02","2021-10-27 01:05:30","2021-10-27 01:05:30","2021-10-27 01:05:30","185-195","","1","33","","Conservation Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/65JEQQYD/Louvrier et al. - 2019 - Use of ambiguous detections to improve estimates f.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intensive management of RABV by oral rabies vaccination (ORV) has prevented its spread westward and shown evidence of local elimination in raccoon populations of the northeastern US. The USDA, Wildlife Services, National Rabies Management Program (NRMP) collaborates with other agencies to implement broad-scale ORV and conducts extensive monitoring to measure the effectiveness of the management. Enhanced Rabies Surveillance (ERS) was initiated during 2005 and updated in 2016 to direct surveillance efforts toward higher-value specimens by assigning points to different methods of encountering specimens for collection (strange-acting, roadkill, surveillance-trapped, etc.; specimen point values ranged from 1 to 15). We used the 2016–2019 data to re-evaluate the point values using a dynamic occupancy model. Additionally, we used ERS data from 2012–2015 and 2016–2019 to examine the impact that the point system had on surveillance data. Implementation of a point system increased positivity rates among specimens by 64%, indicating a substantial increase in the efﬁciency of the ERS to detect wildlife rabies. Our re-evaluation found that most points accurately reﬂect the value of the surveillance specimens. The notable exception was that samples from animals found dead were considerably more valuable for rabies detection than originally considered (original points = 5, new points = 20). This work demonstrates how specimen prioritization strategies can be used to reﬁne and improve ERS in support of wildlife rabies management.","2021-09-09","2021-10-27 01:05:33","2021-10-27 01:05:33","2021-10-27 01:05:33","1795","","9","13","","Viruses","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/2L38YNQU/Davis et al. - 2021 - Data-Driven Management—A Dynamic Occupancy Approac.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Instream and watershed urbanization may inﬂuence the habitat value that tidal creeks provide to blue crabs. We investigated natural and anthropogenic factors inﬂuencing juvenile blue crab occupancy dynamics in eight ﬁrst-order tidal creeks in coastal North Carolina (USA). An auto-logistic hierarchical multi-season (dynamic) occupancy model with separate ecological and observation sub-models was ﬁtted to juvenile blue crab presence/absence data collected over replicate sampling visits in multiple seasons at three ﬁxed trapping sites in each creek. Colonization and survival are the processes operating on occupancy that are estimated with this formulation of the model. Covariates considered in the ecological sub-model included watershed imperviousness, the percent of salt marsh in each creek’s high tide area, percent salt marsh edge, site-level water depth, and site-level salinity. Temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen were covariates considered in the observation sub-model. In the ecological sub-model, watershed imperviousness was a meaningful negative covariate and site-level salinity was a positive covariate of survival probability. Imperviousness and salinity were each marginally meaningful on colonization probability. Water temperature was a positive covariate of detection probability in the observation sub-model. Mean estimated detection probability across all sites and seasons of the study was 0.186. The results suggest that development in tidal creek watersheds will impact occupancy dynamics of juvenile blue crabs. This places an emphasis on minimizing losses of natural land cover classes in tidal creek watersheds to reduce the negative impacts to populations of this important species. Future research should explore the relationship between imperviousness and salinity ﬂuctuations in tidal creeks to better understand how changing land cover inﬂuences water chemistry and ultimately the demographics of juvenile blue crabs.","2021-10-07","2021-10-27 01:11:08","2021-10-27 01:11:09","2021-10-27 01:11:08","491","","10","13","","Diversity","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/Y2EI65WR/Rudershausen et al. - 2021 - Factors Influencing Colonization and Survival of J.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Occupancy models have arisen as the main tool to reduce effects of limited knowledge about effort in analyses of opportunistic data. These models are generally using long closure periods (e.g., breeding season) for the estimation of probability of detection and occurrence. Here, we use the fact that multiple opportunistic observations in biodiversity databases may be available even within days (e.g., at popular birding localities) to reduce the closure period to 1 day in order to estimate daily occupancies within the breeding season. We use a hierarchical dynamic occupancy model for daily visits to analyze opportunistic observations of 71 species from nine wetlands during 10 years. Our model derives measures of seasonal site use within seasons from estimates of daily occupancy. Comparing results from our “seasonal site use model” to results from a traditional annual occupancy model (using a closure criterion of 2 months or more) showed that our model provides more detailed biologically relevant information. For example, when the aim is to analyze occurrences of breeding species, an annual occupancy model will over-­estimate site use of species with temporary occurrences (e.g., migrants passing by, single itinerary prospecting individuals) as even a single observation during the closure period will be viewed as an occupancy. Alternatively, our model produces estimates of the extent to which sites are actually used. Model validation based on simulated data confirmed that our model is robust to changes and variability in sampling effort and species detectability. We conclude that more information can be gained from opportunistic data with multiple replicates (e.g., several reports per day almost every day) by reducing the time window of the closure criterion to acquire estimates of occupancies within seasons.","2017-08","2021-10-27 01:11:14","2021-10-27 01:11:14","2021-10-27 01:11:14","5632-5644","","15","7","","Ecol Evol","Exploiting opportunistic observations to estimate changes in seasonal site use","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/2AMU6A37/Ruete et al. - 2017 - Exploiting opportunistic observations to estimate .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is possible, however, that artiﬁcial habitats provide conditions for a minor proportion of the regional species pool, beneﬁting just a few widespread generalists. We assessed these alternative views by documenting the decline of temporary ponds in a Mediterranean farmland landscape between 1991 and 2009, and by estimating the occupancy of natural (temporary ponds and streams) and artiﬁcial water bodies (farm ponds, irrigation channels and drainage ditches) by amphibians across the breeding season (February–June 2010). We used hierarchical Bayesian dynamic multi-species occupancy modelling to control for differences in detectability across species, sampling occasions and habitat types. Over two decades the farmland landscape lost 56% of its temporary ponds, of which 89.3% were destroyed through agricultural activities such as cultivation, conversion to permanent farm ponds, and drainage. The survival rate of ponds was lowest within an irrigated perimeter, and there was no positive effect of protection by a natural park. Estimated species richness per site was at least twice as high in temporary ponds as in the other habitat types. From the 10 amphibian species recorded, seven had the highest occupancy in temporary ponds, and were absent or occurred rarely in artiﬁcial habitats. Only a single generalist species was widespread in farm ponds and irrigation channels. The results suggest that artiﬁcial water bodies are unlikely to sustain populations of most amphibian species in Mediterranean intensive farmland. Conservation efforts should be directed at protecting the temporary ponds still remaining within the farmed landscape, and at restoring or creating new temporary ponds where these have been lost during the last decades.","2013-09","2021-10-27 01:17:05","2021-10-27 01:17:05","2021-10-27 01:17:05","179-186","","","165","","Biological Conservation","Mediterranean amphibians and the loss of temporary ponds","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/SB2SSMER/Ferreira and Beja - 2013 - Mediterranean amphibians and the loss of temporary.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated the effectiveness of green-tree retention for conserving mature forest-associated, generalist, and early-successional songbirds in aspen stands that were 1–15 years postharvest. We compared species occupancy estimates at sites where green-tree retention levels were exceeded (>10% canopy cover), met (3–10%), or below (<3%) recommended retention guidelines. We also compared the relative importance of these levels of green-tree retention to forest stand age in explaining songbird occurrence. With the exception of Red-eyed Vireos, our results suggest that current green-tree retention guidelines are ineffective at increasing site occupancy of mature forest-associated songbirds in aspen harvest units. Additionally, site occupancy of early-successional and generalist songbirds were unaffected by these levels of retention. Rather, site occupancy probabilities for most forest birds showed a clear association with age since harvest (1–15 years); however, the strength and direction of the association varied by species. Our research highlights the importance of considering forest stand age when assessing the impact of silvicultural prescriptions on forest songbirds. Future management objectives in aspen forests should reﬂect the value of clearcutting to early-successional and generalist bird species, while recognizing that green-tree retention as measured in our study does little to promote occupancy of the mature forest-associated bird community.","2012-11","2021-10-27 01:17:08","2021-10-27 01:17:08","2021-10-27 01:17:08","241-250","","","284","","Forest Ecology and Management","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/NA7F63Q9/Otto and Roloff - 2012 - Songbird response to green-tree retention prescrip.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly true for tigers (Panthera tigris), now largely dependent on small and fragmented habitats, embedded within densely populated agroecosystems in India. Devising a comprehensive conservation strategy for the species requires an understanding of the temporal patterns of space use by tiger within these human-modiﬁed areas. These areas are often characterized by altered prey communities, novel risks resulting from high human densities and seasonally dynamic vegetative cover. Understanding space use within these areas is vital to devising human-tiger conﬂict prevention measures and for conserving landscape elements critical to maintain functional connectivity between populations. We documented seasonal space-use patterns of tigers in agricultural lands surrounding protected areas in the Central Terai Landscape (CTL) in northern India. We estimated the probability of space use and its drivers by applying dynamic occupancy models that correct for false-positive and false-negative errors to tiger detection\non-detection data within agricultural areas. These data were generated by conducting local interviews, sign surveys, and camera trapping within 94 randomly selected 2.5-km2 grid cells. We found that agricultural areas were used with high probability in the winter (0.64; standard error [SE] 0.08), a period of high vegetative cover availability. The use of agricultural lands was lower in the summer (0.56; SE 0.09) and was lowest in the monsoon season (0.21; SE 0.07), tracking a decline in vegetative cover and available habitat across the landscape. Availability of vegetative cover and drainage features positively inﬂuenced space use, whereas use declined with increasing distance to protected areas and the extent of human settlements. These ﬁndings highlight the role of agricultural areas in providing seasonal habitats for tigers and offer a basis for understanding where tigers and humans co-occur in these landscapes. These ﬁndings help expand our current understanding of what constitutes large carnivore habitats to include human-dominated agricultural areas. They underscore the need for greater integration of land-sharing and land-sparing initiatives to conserve large carnivores within humandominated agroecosystems.","2020-07","2021-10-27 01:17:16","2021-10-27 01:17:16","2021-10-27 01:17:16","","","7","11","","Ecosphere","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/XVEJ247Q/Warrier et al. - 2020 - Agricultural lands offer seasonal habitats to tige.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When multiple threats act on an SSP, a comparison of the different factors determining local extinctions and colonizations is essential to plan sound conservation actions. We assessed the drivers of long-term population dynamics of multiple amphibian species at the regional scale. We used dynamic occupancy models within a Bayesian framework to identify the factors determining persistence and colonization of local populations. Because connectivity among patches is fundamental to SSPs dynamics, we considered 2 measures of connectivity acting on each focal patch: incidence of the focal species and incidence of invasive crayfish. We used meta-analysis to summarize the effect of different drivers at the community level. Persistence and colonization of local populations were jointly determined by factors acting at different scales. Persistence probability was positively related to the area and the permanence of wetlands, whereas it was negatively related to occurrence of fish. Colonization probability was highest in semipermanent wetlands and in sites with a high incidence of the focal species in nearby sites, whereas it showed a negative relationship with the incidence of invasive crayfish in the landscape. By analyzing long-term data on amphibian population dynamics, we found a strong effect of some classic features commonly used in SSP studies, such as patch area and focal species incidence. The presence of an invasive non-native species at the landscape scale emerged as one of the strongest drivers of colonization dynamics, suggesting that studies on SSPs should consider different connectivity measures more frequently, such as the incidence of predators, especially when dealing with biological invasions.","2021-10","2021-10-27 01:17:18","2021-10-27 01:17:18","2021-10-27 01:17:18","1530-1539","","5","35","","Conservation Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/CDC78QMY/Falaschi et al. - 2021 - Long‐term drivers of persistence and colonization .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over 5 years, we estimated changes in occupancy and probabilities of colonization and survival in 13 stream catchments after urbanization and in 17 catchments that were not urbanized. We also examined effects of proportion of urbanized area in a catchment and distance of the salamander population to the nearest stream on probabilities of colonization and survival. Before urbanization, adult and larval stages of the two salamander species occupied nearly all surveyed streams, with occupancy estimates ranging from 1.0 to 0.78. Four years after urbanization mean occupancy of larval and adult two-lined salamanders had decreased from 0.87 and 0.78 to 0.57 and 0.39, respectively. Estimates of mean occupancy of larval northern dusky salamanders decreased from 1.0 to 0.57 in urban streams 4 years after urbanization; however, adult northern dusky salamander occupancy remained close to 1.0 in urban streams over 5 years. Occupancy estimates in control streams were similar for each species and stage over 5 years. Urbanization was associated with decreases in survival probabilities of adult and larval two-lined salamanders and decreases in colonization probabilities of larval dusky salamanders. Nevertheless, proportion of impervious surface and distance to nearest stream had little effect on probabilities of survival and colonization. Our results imply that in the evaluation of the effects of urbanization on species, such as amphibians, with complex life cycles, consideration of the effects of urbanization on both adult and larval stages is required.","2011-06","2021-10-27 01:17:23","2021-10-27 01:17:24","2021-10-27 01:17:23","547-555","","3","25","","","Effects of Urbanization on Occupancy of Stream Salamanders","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/7W7MH3UN/Price et al. - 2011 - Effects of Urbanization on Occupancy of Stream Sal.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Distributional shifts have been demonstrated in many ecosystems and taxa, yet the extent and nature of these changes remain largely undocumented for tropical forest mammals. Shifts over short time periods can be particularly alarming in areas of the world where mammals are already under threat as a result of human activities. This is the case for Madagascar, an island where deforestation, hunting, invasive species, and other human threats have resulted in the extinction of several endemic species. Here, we ask, are the distributions of Malagasy mammals changing? We test this by modeling local colonization and extinction dynamics, which are the biological processes that produce distributional shifts. We use camera trap data from the TEAM Network for four species along a 570 m elevational gradient in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. The endemic Eastern red forest rat (Nesomys rufus) declined in overall occupancy while the non-native bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) increased in occupancy overall. The two endemic carnivore species shifted their elevational use: the Malagasy ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) retracted from higher elevations and the Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana) moved to higher elevations, likely in response to anthropogenic pressures. These results show that shifts are occurring and we can detect them with just six years of data.

We evaluated the status, trends, and distribution of mammals ≥ 0.5 kg in the Ebo forest over 12 years using guided recce and camera trap monitoring surveys, as well as local knowledge to inform future land use and conservation planning. Recce monitoring of six taxa (blue duiker Philantomba monticola, chimpanzee Pan troglodytes, forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis, putty-nosed monkey Cercopithecus nictitans, medium sized duikers Cephalophus spp., and red river hog Potamochoerus porcus) showed that some are stable or increasing. Indeed, our recent camera trap data confirmed breeding Gorilla gorilla (western gorilla) and elephant. Distribution models for chimpanzees and elephants showed that their populations are concentrated in the centre of the forest, away from human pressure. Some other species, however, including red colobus Piliocolobus preussi, leopard Panthera pardus, African golden cat Caracal aurata, and forest buffalo Syncerus caffer nanus are either close to extirpation or have been extirpated within living memory. We conclude that the Ebo intact forest landscape retains an important mammal community, despite no formal legal protection. Ebo’s future is uncertain, with two commercial logging concessions announced by Cameroon in 2020 and later suspended in response to national and international pressure.

We used point count and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011 – 2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since 1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects, number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest, and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05 and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in efforts to conserve this rare species.","2014","2021-10-27 01:20:42","2021-10-27 01:20:42","2021-10-27 01:20:42","art3","","2","9","","ACE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/ECZFA3Z5/Fogg et al. - 2014 - Occurrence patterns of Black-backed Woodpeckers in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the stopover ecology of the golden-plover in the agricultural matrix of east-central Illinois and west-central Indiana between 2008 and 2012. We found that golden-plovers remained in the region for ~45 days and individuals spent on average 24 days in the area before departing to the northwest. During a period of peak migration, golden-plovers preferred fields with standing water and, to a lesser extent, soybean fields. Over the 45-day stopover duration, goldenplovers moved extensively (shown by a dynamic occupancy model and area used estimation), with some evidence for tilled fields becoming unoccupied at greater rates than untilled fields. The tendency to use fields with standing water and the movement of individuals from tilled fields suggests that food accessibility, rather than food abundance, is likely a critical factor associated with the prolonged stay, movement, and field type selection of golden-plovers. Food accessibility is important to the golden-plover because they undergo molt into breeding plumage in the region and must refuel for the next leg of their migration. The Midwest is a key stopover location for American Golden-Plovers and promoting foraging conditions by manipulating the drainage of agricultural fields, via the temporary blockage of drain tiles, should be a management focus.","2014-05","2021-10-27 01:20:45","2021-10-27 01:20:45","2021-10-27 01:20:45","162-172","","2","116","","The Condor","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/XKR6BEU4/Stodola et al. - 2014 - Stopover ecology of American Golden-Plovers ( P.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Management solutions such as direct protection or supplementary feeding typically aim at reducing mortality or increasing productivity, but demonstrating such demographic consequences of adopted management is often difﬁcult. Here we assess the effectiveness of large-scale management actions aimed at the conservation of an endangered vulture on the Balkan Peninsula by extending a novel analysis to estimate seasonal adult survival from observations of unmarked individuals. We monitored Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus breeding success and territory occupancy over 11 years in three countries during which both nest guarding and supplementary feeding were carried out. We found little evidence that nest guarding and supplementary feeding increased breeding propensity (mean = 0.88 ± 0.32 standard deviation, n = 463), breeding success (0.82 ± 0.39), or the number of ﬂedglings raised by successful pairs (1.3 ± 0.74). We estimated adult survival during the 23-week breeding season (mean = 0.936, 95% credible interval 0.889–0.968) and found no signiﬁcant increase due to management. In the last 13 years 43 dead adult birds have been found during the breeding season, and 77% of conﬁrmed mortalities were due to poisoning. Overall, the current management measures may have so far failed to halt ongoing population declines because the beneﬁcial effects are insufﬁcient to offset the loss of adult birds for example due to poisoning. We suggest that additional measures to slow the decline of Egyptian Vultures in the Balkans are required. In the short term, we urge governments to enforce anti-poison regulations that already exist. In the medium term, alternative approaches need to be developed that reduce the use of poisons and the associated accidental mortality of vultures and other wildlife species.","2016-06","2021-10-27 01:20:53","2021-10-27 01:20:53","2021-10-27 01:20:53","157-164","","","198","","Biological Conservation","Assessing the effectiveness of intensive conservation actions","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/S4QUAVRE/Oppel et al. - 2016 - Assessing the effectiveness of intensive conservat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been increasingly appreciated that these parameters must be estimated separately from detection probability to avoid the biases induced by nondetection error. Hence, there is now considerable theoretical and practical interest in dynamic occupancy models that contain explicit representations of metapopulation dynamics such as extinction, colonization, and turnover as well as growth rates. We describe a hierarchical parameterization of these models that is analogous to the state-space formulation of models in time series, where the model is represented by two components, one for the partially observable occupancy process and another for the observations conditional on that process. This parameterization naturally allows estimation of all parameters of the conventional approach to occupancy models, but in addition, yields great ﬂexibility and extensibility, e.g., to modeling heterogeneity or latent structure in model parameters. We also highlight the important distinction between population and ﬁnite sample inference; the latter yields much more precise estimates for the particular sample at hand. Finite sample estimates can easily be obtained using the state-space representation of the model but are difﬁcult to obtain under the conventional approach of likelihood-based estimation. We use R and WinBUGS to apply the model to two examples. In a standard analysis for the European Crossbill in a large Swiss monitoring program, we ﬁt a model with year-speciﬁc parameters. Estimates of the dynamic parameters varied greatly among years, highlighting the irruptive population dynamics of that species. In the second example, we analyze route occupancy of Cerulean Warblers in the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) using a model allowing for site-speciﬁc heterogeneity in model parameters. The results indicate relatively low turnover and a stable distribution of Cerulean Warblers which is in contrast to analyses of counts of individuals from the same survey that indicate important declines. This discrepancy illustrates the inertia in occupancy relative to actual abundance. Furthermore, the model reveals a declining patch survival probability, and increasing turnover, toward the edge of the range of the species, which is consistent with metapopulation perspectives on the genesis of range edges. Given detection/non-detection data, dynamic occupancy models as described here have considerable potential for the study of distributions and range dynamics.","2007-07","2021-10-27 01:20:57","2021-10-27 01:20:57","2021-10-27 01:20:57","1813-1823","","7","88","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/IQRHEX4F/Royle and Kéry - 2007 - A BAYESIAN STATE-SPACE FORMULATION OF DYNAMIC OCCU.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, there is growing evidence the congeneric invasive barred owl (Strix varia) may be responsible for the continued decline primarily by excluding spotted owls from their preferred habitat. We used a long-term demographic study for spotted owls in coastal northern California as the basis for a pilot barred owl removal experiment. Our demography study used capture–recapture, reproductive output, and territory occupancy data collected from 1990 to 2013 to evaluate trends in vital rates and populations. We used a classic before-after-control-impact (BACI) experimental design to investigate the demographic response of northern spotted owls to the lethal removal of barred owls. According to the best 2-species dynamic occupancy model, there was no evidence of differences in barred or northern spotted owl occupancy prior to the initiation of the treatment (barred owl removal). After treatment, barred owl occupancy was lower in the treated relative to the untreated areas and spotted owl occupancy was higher relative to the untreated areas. Barred owl removal decreased spotted owl territory extinction rates but did not affect territory colonization rates. As a result, spotted owl occupancy increased in the treated area and continued to decline in the untreated areas. Prior to and after barred owl removal, there was no evidence that average fecundity differed on the 2 study areas. However, the greater number of occupied spotted owl sites on the treated areas resulted in greater productivity in the treated areas based on empirical counts of ﬂedged young. Prior to removal, survival was declining at a rate of approximately 0.2% per year for treated and untreated areas. Following treatment, estimated survival was 0.859 for the treated areas and 0.822 for the untreated areas. Derived estimates of population change on both study areas showed the same general decline before removal with an estimated slope of –0.0036 per year. Following removal, the rate of population change on the treated areas increased to an average of 1.029 but decreased to an average of 0.870 on the untreated areas. The results from this ﬁrst experiment demonstrated that lethal removal of barred owls allowed the recovery of northern spotted owl populations in the treated portions of our study area. If additional federally funded barred owl removal experiments provide similar results, this could be the foundation for development of a long-term conservation strategy for northern spotted owls.

With this in mind, we assessed the rate of post-hurricane recovery and long term viability of the Alabama beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus ammobates). We collected detection/nondetection data across the range of the Alabama beach mouse for four years subsequent to hurricanes Ivan and Katrina, and then ﬁt a dynamic patch occupancy model to these data using hierarchical Bayesian methods. We converted remotely sensed data into habitat classes, and then mapped site survival probability over the entire range of the species. These estimates were then used to parameterize a spatially-explicit population viability analysis. Our occupancy modeling demonstrates that the probability of patch occupancy increased from 0.16 to 0.67, with occupancy in the surveyed patches approaching an asymptote by the third post-hurricane summer. The viability analysis suggests that extinction probability increases nonlinearly with monotonic increases in both habitat loss and hurricane frequency. Extinction risk is sensitive to the regularity of catastrophic hurricanes; consecutive hurricanes dramatically increase extinction risk, further suggesting that the effect of global climate change on hurricane regimes may have a large effect on the probability of long-term persistence. A mild interaction between habitat loss and hurricane frequency occurs when extinction probability is relatively low, but disappears as extinction probability increases. Our results indicate that extinction risk is a complex function of multiple interacting drivers.","2014-10","2021-10-27 01:26:22","2021-10-27 01:26:22","2021-10-27 01:26:22","28-36","","","178","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/9DINLZAG/Falcy and Danielson - 2014 - Post-hurricane recovery and long-term viability of.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we employed environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys to efficiently generate multiseason rangewide site occupancy histories. Second, we developed a novel dynamic, spatial multiscale occupancy model to estimate metapopulation dynamics. The model incorporates spatial relationships, explicitly accounts for non-detection bias and allows direct evaluation of the drivers of extinction and colonization. We applied these tools to examine metapopulation dynamics of endangered tidewater goby, a species endemic to California estuarine habitats. We analysed rangewide eDNA data from 190 geographically isolated sites (813 total water samples) surveyed from 2 years (2016 and 2017). Rangewide estimates of the proportion of sites that were occupied varied little between 2016 (0.52) and 2017 (0.51). However, there was evidence of extinction and colonization dynamics. The probability of extinction of an occupied site (0.106) and probability of colonization of an unoccupied site (0.085) were nearly equal. Stability in site occupancy proportions combined with nearly equal rates of extinction and colonization suggests a dynamic equilibrium between the 2 years surveyed. Assessment of covariate effects revealed that colonization probability increased as the number of occupied neighbouring sites increased and as distance between occupied sites decreased. We show that eDNA surveys can rapidly provide a snapshot of a species distribution over a broad geographic range and, when these surveys are paired with occupancy modelling, can uncover metapopulation dynamics and their drivers.","2021-07","2021-10-27 01:26:24","2021-10-27 01:26:24","2021-10-27 01:26:24","3340-3354","","13","30","","Mol Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/Z6YK8NWA/Martel et al. - 2021 - Using environmental DNA and occupancy modelling to.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many other streams with poorer habitat had small populations that were not persistent over time and were periodically recolonized by dispersers from other streams. Although it is often assumed population diversity and resiliency is maximized when all available habitats are used, for this salmon metapopulation, resiliency is due to the core streams of higher habitat quality.

For a well-established invasive species in the spreading phase of invasion, a useful metric of impact is the magnitude by which control slows the rate of spatial spread. The prevention of spatial spreading likely results in substantial beneﬁts in terms of ecosystem or economic damage that is prevented by an expanding invasive species. To understand how local management actions could impact the spatial spread of an established invasive species, we analyzed distribution and management data for feral swine across contiguous United States using occupancy analysis. We quantiﬁed changes in the rate of spatial expansion of feral swine and its relationship to local management actions. We found that after 4 yr of enhanced control, invasion probability decreased by 8% on average relative to pre-program rates. This decrease was as high as 15% on average in states with low-density populations of feral swine. The amount of decrease in invasion rate was attributed to removal intensity in neighboring counties and depended on the extent of neighboring counties with feral swine (spatial heterogeneity in local invasion pressure). Although we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant overall increase in the probability of elimination, increased elimination probability tended to occur in regions with low invasion pressure. Accounting for spatial heterogeneity in invasion pressure was important for quantifying management impacts (i.e., the relationship between management intensity and spatial spreading processes) because management impacts changed depending on the strength of invasion pressure from neighboring counties. Predicting reduction in spatial spread of an invasive species is an important ﬁrst step in valuation of overall damage reduction for invasive species control programs by providing estimates of where a species may be, and thus which natural and agricultural resources would be affected, if the control program had not been operating. For minimizing losses from spatial expansion of an invasive species, our framework can be used for adaptive resource prioritization to areas where spatial expansion and underlying damage potential are concurrently highest.","2019-03","2021-10-27 01:30:05","2021-10-27 01:30:05","2021-10-27 01:30:05","","","3","10","","Ecosphere","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/QF6XVPFV/Pepin et al. - 2019 - Accounting for heterogeneous invasion rates reveal.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Projections based on widely used static modeling methods implicitly assume that species are in equilibrium with the environment and that detection during surveys is perfect. We used multiseason correlated detection occupancy models, which avoid these assumptions, to relate climate data to distributional shifts of Louisiana Waterthrush in the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. We summarized these shifts with indices of range size and position and compared them to the same indices obtained using more basic modeling approaches. Detection rates during point counts in BBS surveys were low, and models that ignored imperfect detection severely underestimated the proportion of area occupied and slightly overestimated mean latitude. Static models indicated Louisiana Waterthrush distribution was most closely associated with moderate temperatures, while dynamic occupancy models indicated that initial occupancy was associated with diurnal temperature ranges and colonization of sites was associated with moderate precipitation. Overall, the proportion of area occupied and mean latitude changed little during the 1997–2013 study period. Near-term forecasts of species distribution generated by dynamic models were more similar to subsequently observed distributions than forecasts from static models. Occupancy models incorporating a ﬁnite mixture model on detection – a new extension to correlated detection occupancy models – were better supported and may reduce bias associated with detection heterogeneity. We argue that replacing phenomenological static models with more mechanistic dynamic models can improve projections of future species distributions. In turn, better projections can improve biodiversity forecasts, management decisions, and understanding of global change biology.","2016-10","2021-10-27 01:33:37","2021-10-27 01:33:37","2021-10-27 01:33:37","3273-3285","","10","22","","Glob Change Biol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/CFDKFPMS/Clement et al. - 2016 - Estimating indices of range shifts in birds using .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used Landsat data to develop maps of canopy cover for each study area, which we then used to quantify annual territory-specific habitat covariates. We modeled the relationships between territory extinction and colonization using predictor variables of habitat, disturbance (logging, fire), climate, and elevation. We found that forests with medium (40–69%) and high (!70%) canopy cover were the most important predictors of territory occupancy in all study areas, and that both canopy cover categories were positively correlated with occupancy. We used analysis of deviance to estimate the amount of variation explained by the habitat covariates (primarily medium and high canopy cover) and found that these covariates explained from 35% to 67% of the variation in occupancy. Climatic covariates were not correlated with occupancy dynamics and explained little of the variation in occupancy. We also conducted a post hoc analysis in which we partitioned canopy cover into 10% classes, because our original partitioning into 3 classes may have lacked sufficient resolution to identify canopy cover levels where occupancy changed abruptly. In this post hoc analysis, occupancy declined sharply when territories contained more area with ,40% canopy cover, and the amount of 50–59% and 60–69% canopy cover had a more positive association with occupancy than did 40–49% canopy cover. Our results suggest that some fuels treatments intended to reduce fire risk and improve forest resilience could be located within Spotted Owl territories without adversely impacting territory occupancy if such treatments do not consistently reduce canopy cover below 50%. We suggest that future work quantify components of forest structure (e.g., large tree density, vertical complexity) known to be selected by owls and relate these characteristics to occupancy and fitness metrics.","2016-11","2021-10-27 01:33:39","2021-10-27 01:33:40","2021-10-27 01:33:39","747-765","","4","118","","The Condor","Meta-analysis of California Spotted Owl ( <i>Strix occidentalis occidentalis</i> ) territory occupancy in the Sierra Nevada","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/86589T3L/Tempel et al. - 2016 - Meta-analysis of California Spotted Owl ( Strix.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, false negatives and false positives produced by automated detection systems can compromise the utility of these data for researchers and land managers, particularly for research programs endeavoring to describe colonization and extinction dynamics that inform land use decision-making. To investigate the suitability of automated acoustic monitoring for dynamic occurrence models, we simulated underlying occurrence dynamics, calling patterns, and the automated acoustic detection process for a hypothetical species under a range of scenarios. We investigated an automated species detection aggregation method that considered a suite of options for creating encounter histories. From these encounter histories, we generated parameter estimates and computed bias for occurrence, colonization, and extinction rates using a dynamic occupancy modeling framework that accounts for false positives via small amounts of manual confirmation. We were able to achieve relatively unbiased estimates for all three state parameters under all scenarios, even when the automated detection system was simulated to be poor, given particular encounter history aggregation choices. However, some encounter history aggregation choices resulted in unreliable estimates; we provide caveats for avoiding these scenarios. Given specific choices during the detection aggregation process, automated acoustic monitoring data may provide an effective means for tracking species occurrence, colonization, and extinction patterns through time, with the potential to inform adaptive management at multiple spatial scales.","2019-04","2021-10-27 01:33:43","2021-10-27 01:33:43","2021-10-27 01:33:43","","","3","29","","Ecol Appl","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/TWN2JUD3/Balantic and Donovan - 2019 - Dynamic wildlife occupancy models using automated .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Species ranges are typically estimated using correlative species distribution models (SDMs), which have been criticized for their static nature. In contrast, dynamic occupancy models (DOMs) explicitily describe temporal changes in species’ occupancy via colonization and local extinction probabilities, estimated from time series of occurrence data. Yet, tests of whether these models improve predictive accuracy under current or future conditions are rare. Using a long-­ term data set on 69 Swiss birds, we tested whether DOMs improve the predictions of distribution changes over time compared to SDMs. We evaluated the accuracy of spatial predictions and their ability to detect population trends. We also explored how predictions differed when we accounted for imperfect detection and parameterized models using calibration data sets of different time series lengths. All model types had high spatial predictive performance when assessed across all sites (mean AUC > 0.8), with flexible machine learning SDM algorithms outperforming parametric static and DOMs. However, none of the models performed well at identifying sites where range changes are likely to occur. In terms of estimating population trends, DOMs performed best, particularly for species with strong population changes and when fit with sufficient data, while static SDMs performed very poorly. Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering what aspects of performance matter most when selecting a modelling method for a particular application and the need for further research to improve model utility. While DOMs show promise for capturing range dynamics and inferring population trends when fitted with sufficient data, computational constraints on variable selection and model fitting can lead to reduced spatial accuracy of predictions, an area warranting more attention.","2021-09","2021-10-27 01:33:45","2021-10-27 01:33:45","2021-10-27 01:33:45","4269-4282","","18","27","","Glob Change Biol","Can dynamic occupancy models improve predictions of species' range dynamics?","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/EQGVYZGR/Briscoe et al. - 2021 - Can dynamic occupancy models improve predictions o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
