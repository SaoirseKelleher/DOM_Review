Models are needed for understanding and predicting metapopulation dynamics in changing landscapes. One particularly important question is what is the effect of habitat loss to the persistence of a metapopulation. A class of metapopulation models that have been successfully used in practical applications are called stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs), which model the presence/absence of the species on habitat patches as a Markov chain. The presence–absence assumption makes the model relatively parameter sparse, facilitates empirical data collection, and enables rigorous parameter estimation. This study reviews theory of SPOMs and describes a computational tool, called SPOMSIM, which allows one to simulate SPOMs and estimate parameters for them. SPOMSIM offers a range of choices for submodels; alternatives are provided for the functional forms of local extinction, the dispersal kernel, computation of connectivity, the colonization function, the implementation of the rescue effect and the implementation of regional stochasticity. SPOMSIM includes also, among other things, a utility based on hierarchical clustering for the analysis of the structure of a patch network, a reserve network optimization algorithm, and a patch system editor which makes it possible to investigate the consequences of changes in landscape structure. Potential uses for SPOMSIM include scientiﬁc metapopulation studies, teaching and conservation management.","2004-12","2021-10-27 04:28:44","2021-10-27 04:28:44","2021-10-27 04:28:44","533-550","","4","179","","Ecological Modelling","SPOMSIM","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/ZSZW2IID/Moilanen - 2004 - SPOMSIM software for stochastic patch occupancy m.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we suggest a general classification of the dynamics that allows one to identify, in a model-independent way, the regimes where coherence effects are strong. We also present a new technique, based on patch occupancy (presence/absence) data, to identify the role of spatial coherence in the stabilization of a metapopulation and to give an early warning against the possibility of regional-scale extinction. When this scenario occurs a decrease in the movement of individuals (habitat fragmentation, reduced dispersal rates) has a positive effect on the sustainability of the spatially distributed population. The results of individual based simulations of a spatially structured population are analyzed with SPOM and the regime where the two-state approximation is fails is identified.","2012-06","2021-10-27 04:28:46","2021-10-27 04:28:46","2021-10-27 04:28:46","985-997","","6","121","","Oikos","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/HDENXWYQ/Ben-Zion and Shnerb - 2012 - Coherence, conservation and patch-occupancy analys.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Secondly, the area of the habitat patches is assumed to scale with the number of patches in the metapopulation.

Typically this endeavor is facilitated either by models from classic metapopulation theory focused on spatially explicit, dispersal-driven colonization–extinction dynamics and generally assuming perfect detection, or by more recent hierarchical site occupancy models that account for imperfect detection but rarely include spatial effects, such as dispersal, explicitly. Neither approach explicitly considers local demographics in a way that can be used for future projections. However, despite being arguably of equal importance, dispersal and connectivity, local demography, and imperfect detection are rarely modeled explicitly and simultaneously. Understanding the spatiotemporal occurrence patterns of spatially structured populations and making biologically realistic long-term predictions of persistence would beneﬁt from the simultaneous treatment of space, demography, and detectability. We integrated these key ideas in a tractable and intuitive way to develop a demographic and spatially realistic patch occupancy model that incorporates components of dispersal, local demographic stage-structure, and detectability. By explicitly relating stage-speciﬁc abundances to measurable patch properties, biologically realistic projections of long-term metapopulation dynamics could be made. We applied our model to data from a naturally fragmented population of water voles Arvicola amphibius to describe observed patch occupancy dynamics and to investigate long-term persistence under scenarios of elevated stage-speciﬁc local extinction. Accounting for biases induced by imperfect detection, we were able to estimate: stable, and higher than observed metapopulation occupancy; high rates of patch turnover and stage-speciﬁc colonization and extinction rates ( juvenile and adult, respectively); and juvenile dispersal distances (average 2.10 km). We found that metapopulation persistence in the presence of elevated extinction risk differed depending on which life stage was exposed, and was more sensitive to elevated juvenile rather than adult extinction risk. Predictions of persistence when dynamics are stage-speciﬁc suggest that metapopulations may be more resilient to changes in the environment than predicted when relationships are based on patch size approximations rather than population sizes. Our approach allows explicit consideration of local dynamics and dispersal in spatially structured and stage-structured populations, provides a more detailed mechanistic understanding of metapopulation functioning, and can be used to investigate future extinction risk under biologically meaningful scenarios.","2014-11","2021-10-27 04:28:59","2021-10-27 04:28:59","2021-10-27 04:28:59","3149-3160","","11","95","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/68XYEIJT/Sutherland et al. - 2014 - A demographic, spatially explicit patch occupancy .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs) are popular tools for examining spatial and temporal dynamics of populations when presence–absence data in multiple habitat patches are available. We developed a Bayesian Markov chain method that extends existing SPOMs by focusing on past environmental changes that may have altered occupancy patterns prior to the beginning of data collection. Using occupancy data from 3 creeks, we applied the method to assess 2 hypothesized causes of population decline—in situ die-off and residual impact of past source population loss—in the California red-legged frog. Despite having no data for the 20–30 years between the hypothetical event leading to population decline and the first data collected, we were able to discriminate among hypotheses, finding evidence that in situ die-off increased in 2 of the creeks. Although the creeks had comparable numbers of occupied segments, owing to different extinction–colonization dynamics, our model predicted an 8-fold difference in persistence probabilities of their populations to 2030. Adding a source population led to a greater predicted persistence probability than did decreasing the in situ die-off, emphasizing that reversing the deleterious impacts of a disturbance may not be the most efficient management strategy.

We built a spatially realistic stochastic metapopulation model for the Mount Lofty Ranges Southern Emu-wren (Stipiturus malachurus intermedius), a critically endangered Australian bird. Using discrete-time Markov chains to describe the dynamics of a metapopulation and stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) to ﬁnd optimal solutions, we evaluated the following different management decisions: enlarging existing patches, linking patches via corridors, and creating a new patch. This is the ﬁrst application of SDP to optimal landscape reconstruction and one of the few times that landscape reconstruction dynamics have been integrated with population dynamics. SDP is a powerful tool that has advantages over standard Monte Carlo simulation methods because it can give the exact optimal strategy for every landscape conﬁguration (combination of patch areas and presence of corridors) and pattern of metapopulation occupancy, as well as a trajectory of strategies. It is useful when a sequence of management actions can be performed over a given time horizon, as is the case for many endangered species recovery programs, where only ﬁxed amounts of resources are available in each time step. However, it is generally limited by computational constraints to rather small networks of patches. The model shows that optimal metapopulation management decisions depend greatly on the current state of the metapopulation, and there is no strategy that is universally the best. The extinction probability over 30 yr for the optimal state-dependent management actions is 50–80% better than no management, whereas the best ﬁxed state-independent sets of strategies are only 30% better than no management. This highlights the advantages of using a decision theory tool to investigate conservation strategies for metapopulations. It is clear from these results that the sequence of management actions is critical, and this can only be effectively derived from stochastic dynamic programming. The model illustrates the underlying difﬁculty in determining simple rules of thumb for the sequence of management actions for a metapopulation. This use of a decision theory framework extends the capacity of population viability analysis (PVA) to manage threatened species.","2003-04","2021-10-27 04:34:09","2021-10-27 04:34:09","2021-10-27 04:34:09","543-555","","2","13","","Ecological Applications","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/XIX2NSCC/Westphal et al. - 2003 - THE USE OF STOCHASTIC DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING IN OPTIM.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the recognized importance of stochastic hydroclimatic forcing in driving wetlandscape hydrological dynamics, linking such effects to emergent dynamics of metapopulation poses significant challenges. To fill this gap, we propose here a dynamic stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM), which links parsimonious hydrological and ecological models to simulate spatio-temporal patterns in species occupancy in wetlandscapes. Our work aims to place ecological studies of patchy habitats into a proper hydrologic and climatic framework to improve the knowledge about metapopulation shifts in response to climate-driven changes in wetlandscapes. We applied the dynamic version of the SPOM (D-SPOM) framework in two wetlandscapes in the US with contrasting landscape and climate properties. Our results illustrate that explicit consideration of the temporal dimension proposed in the D-SPOM is important to interpret local- and landscape-scale patterns of habitat suitability and metapopulation occupancy. Our analyses show that spatio-temporal dynamics of patch suitability and accessibility, driven by the stochasticity in hydroclimatic forcing, influence metapopulation occupancy and the topological metrics of the emergent wetlandscape dispersal network. D-SPOM simulations also reveal that the extinction risk in dynamic wetlandscapes is exacerbated by extended dry periods when suitable habitat decreases, hence limiting successful patch colonization and exacerbating metapopulation extinction risks. The proposed framework is not restricted only to wetland studies but could also be applied to examine metapopulation dynamics in other types of patchy habitats subjected to stochastic external disturbances.","2021-01-27","2021-10-27 04:34:11","2021-10-27 04:34:11","2021-10-27 04:34:11","201309","","1","8","","R.

Understanding the dynamics of such species will likely require spatially explicit models, and patch-based metapopulation models are potentially appropriate. However, relatively little attention has been paid to developing metapopulation models that include habitat dynamics, and very little to testing the predictions of these models. We tested three predictions from theory about the differences between dynamic habitat metapopulations and their static counterparts using long-term survey data from two metapopulations of the butterﬂy Plebejus argus. As predicted, we showed ﬁrst that the metapopulation inhabiting dynamic habitat had a lower level of habitat occupancy, which could not be accounted for by other differences between the metapopulations. Secondly, we found that patch occupancy did not signiﬁcantly increase with increasing patch connectivity in dynamic habitat, whereas there was a strong positive connectivity–occupancy relationship in static habitat. Thirdly, we found no signiﬁcant relationship between patch occupancy and patch quality in dynamic habitat, whereas there was a strong, positive quality–occupancy relationship in static habitat. Modeling conﬁrmed that the differences in mean patch occupancy and connectivity–occupancy slope could arise without changing the species’ metapopulation parameters—importantly, without changing the dependence of colonization upon connectivity. We found that, for a range of landscape scenarios, successional simulations always produced a lower connectivity–occupancy slope than comparable simulations with static patches, whether compared like-for-like or controlling for mean occupancy. We conclude that landscape-scale studies may often underestimate the importance of connectivity for species occurrence and persistence because habitat turnover can obscure the connectivity–occupancy relationship in commonly available snapshot data.","2009-06","2021-10-27 04:36:51","2021-10-27 04:36:52","2021-10-27 04:36:51","1608-1619","","6","90","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/AZPIZHV9/Hodgson et al. - 2009 - Metapopulation responses to patch connectivity and.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we compare the parameter estimates, model ﬁts, and predictive abilities of two models of metapopulation dynamics: a detailed individual-based model (IBM) and a population-based stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) derived from the IBM. The two models were ﬁtted to a 17-year time series of data for the Glanville fritillary butterﬂy (Melitaea cinxia) inhabiting a network of 72 small meadows. The data consisted of biannual counts of larval groups (IBM) and the annual presence or absence of local populations (SPOM). The models were ﬁtted using a Bayesian state-space approach with a hierarchical random effect structure to account for observational, demographic, and environmental stochasticities. The detection probability of larval groups (IBM) and the probability of false zeros of local populations (SPOM) in the observation models were simultaneously estimated from the timeseries data and independent control data. Prior distributions for dispersal parameters were obtained from a separate analysis of mark–recapture data. Both models ﬁtted the data about equally, but the results were more precise for the IBM than for the SPOM. The two models yielded similar estimates for a random effect parameter describing habitat quality in each patch, which were correlated with independent empirical measures of habitat quality. The modeling results showed that variation in habitat quality inﬂuenced patch occupancy more through the effects on movement behavior at patch edges than on carrying capacity, whereas the latter inﬂuenced the mean population size in occupied patches. The IBM and the SPOM explained 63% and 45%, respectively, of the observed variation in the fraction of occupied habitat area among 75 independent patch networks not used in parameter estimation. We conclude that, while carefully constructed, detailed models can have better predictive ability than simple models, this advantage comes with the cost of greatly increased data requirements and computational challenges. Our results illustrate how complex models can be helpful in facilitating the construction of effective simpler models.","2011-11","2021-10-27 04:36:54","2021-10-27 04:36:54","2021-10-27 04:36:54","581-598","","4","81","","Ecological Monographs","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/3U4KK26J/Harrison et al. - 2011 - Bayesian state-space modeling of metapopulation dy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) research uses a multidisciplinary approach to identify the key actors, processes, and feedbacks that drive metapopulation and landscape dynamics. We describe a framework for modeling metapopulations in CHANS that integrates ecological and social data by coupling stochastic patch occupancy models of metapopulation dynamics with agent-based models of land-use change. We then apply this framework to metapopulations of the threatened black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) and widespread Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) that inhabit patchy, irrigation-fed wetlands in the rangelands of the California Sierra Nevada foothills. We collected data from five diverse sources (rail occupancy surveys, land-use change mapping, a survey of landowner decision making, climate and reservoir databases, and mosquito trapping and West Nile virus testing) and integrated them into an agent-based stochastic patch occupancy model. We used the model to (1) quantify the drivers of metapopulation dynamics, and the potential interactions and feedbacks among them; (2) test predictions of the behavior of metapopulations in dynamic working landscapes; and (3) evaluate the impact of three policy options on metapopulation persistence (irrigation district water cutbacks during drought, incentives for landowners to create wetlands, and incentives for landowners to protect wetlands). Complex metapopulation dynamics emerged when landscapes functioned as CHANS, highlighting the importance of integrating human activities and other ecological processes into metapopulation models. Rail metapopulations were strongly top-down regulated by precipitation, and the black rail’s decade-long decline was caused by the combination of West Nile virus and drought. Theoretical predictions of the two metapopulations’ responses to dynamic landscapes and incentive programs were complicated by heterogeneity in patch quality and CHANS couplings, respectively. Irrigation cutbacks during drought posed a serious extinction risk that neither incentive policy effectively ameliorated.","2019-04-30","2021-10-27 04:37:07","2021-10-27 04:37:07","2021-10-27 04:37:07","e02711","","","","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/KSYBW6WH/Van Schmidt et al. - 2019 - Integrating social and ecological data to model me.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To establish a common framework for population dynamics in patchy habitats, we describe an individual-based model (IBM) involving a diffusion approximation of correlated random walk of individual movements. As an example, we apply the model to the Glanville fritillary butterﬂy (Melitaea cinxia) inhabiting a highly fragmented landscape. We derive stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) approximations for the IBMs assuming pure demographic stochasticity, uncorrelated environmental stochasticity, or completely correlated environmental stochasticity in local dynamics. Using realistic parameter values for the Glanville fritillary, we show that the SPOMs mimic the behavior of the IBMs well. The SPOMs derived from IBMs have parameters that relate directly to the life history and behavior of individuals, which is an advantage for model interpretation and parameter estimation. The modeling approach that we describe here provides a uniﬁed framework for patchy populations with much movements among habitat patches and classic metapopulations with infrequent movements.","","2021-10-27 04:39:20","2021-10-27 04:39:20","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/I6SSMQL7/Ovaskainen and Hanski - From Individual Behavior to Metapopulation Dynamic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A problem with SPOMs has been that if the spatial structure of a heterogeneous habitat patch network is taken into account, the computational effort needed to analyze a SPOM grows as a power of 2n, where n is the number of habitat patches. I propose a computationally feasible approximation method, which approximates the behavior of a heterogeneous SPOM by an “ideal” metapopulation inhabiting a network of identical and equally connected habitat patches. The transformation to the ideal metapopulation is based on weighting the individual patch occupancies by the dynamic values of the habitat patches, which may be calculated from the deterministic mean-ﬁeld approximation of the original SPOM. Conceptually, the method resembles the calculation of the effective size of a population in the context of population genetics. I demonstrate how the method may be applied to SPOMs with ﬂexible structural assumptions and with spatially correlated and temporally varying parameter values. I apply the method to a real habitat patch network inhabited by the Glanville fritillary butterﬂy, illustrating that the metapopulation dynamics of this species are essentially driven by temporal variability in the environmental conditions.","","2021-10-27 04:39:32","2021-10-27 04:39:32","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/F4UY4PHL/Ovaskainen - The Effective Size of a Metapopulation Living in a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the benefits of high-quality habitat may be modulated by the presence of an environmentally persistent pathogen. In some cases, the presence of environmental pathogen reservoirs on high-quality habitat may lead to the creation of ecological traps, wherein host individuals preferentially colonize high-quality habitat, but are then exposed to increased infection risk and disease-induced mortality. We explored this possibility through the development of a stochastic patch occupancy model, where we varied the pathogen’s virulence, transmission rate and environmental persistence as well as the distribution of habitat quality in the host metapopulation. This model suggests that for pathogens with intermediate levels of spread, high-quality habitat can serve as an ecological trap, and can be detrimental to host persistence relative to low-quality habitat. This inversion of the relative roles of high- and low-quality habitat highlights the importance of considering the interaction between spatial structure and pathogen transmission when managing wildlife populations exposed to an environmentally persistent pathogen.","2016-03","2021-10-27 04:39:35","2021-10-27 04:39:35","2021-10-27 04:39:35","160051","","3","3","","R.

In such cases, prioritizing long-vacant patches for restoration is an intuitively appealing strategy for minimizing the eﬀects on endangered species. Metapopulation models grounded in empirical data potentially provide a rigorous framework for developing theoretical “patch vacancy thresholds” (i.e., duration of vacancy required before implementing restoration) and assessing the implications of such criteria for restoration objectives. We develop such a model for spotted owls (Strix occidentalis), which embody the species–ecosystem dilemma given their preference for closed-canopy forests that are also susceptible to severe ﬁre and drought and hence the center of debates about forest restoration intended to reduce ﬁre and drought risk. We leveraged a > 20-year territory occupancy dataset to parameterize a Stochastic Patch Occupancy Model (SPOM) to assess relative risk to a metapopulation of owls in California under alternative conservation guidelines, including a range of vacancy thresholds. Territories with greater amounts of owl habitat were more likely to be recolonized and less likely to go extinct. Importantly, the probability of a vacant owl territory becoming recolonized declined as length of vacancy increased; territories vacant for 1 and 10 years had annual recolonization probabilities of 0.34 and 0.06, respectively. Based on our SPOM, projected territory occupancy rates declined as the vacancy threshold decreased and as habitat within territories was impacted by restoration. However, more liberal territory vacancy thresholds were projected to increase the proportion of territories (and thus landscape) that could be restored and that restored conditions could be maintained with repeated treatments. Reintroducing natural disturbance regimes, which eliminated the need for repeated treatments, was projected to reduce risk to owls, particularly with relaxed vacancy thresholds. We provide a simple, yet novel, metapopulation framework for quantifying how alternative conservation guidelines might impact owl occupancy and inﬂuence forest restoration guidelines. Similar analyses could facilitate restoration eﬀorts in other systems by more explicitly quantifying tradeoﬀs between species–ecosystem objectives.","2018-08","2021-10-27 04:42:02","2021-10-27 04:42:03","2021-10-27 04:42:02","248-257","","","224","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/BNNPVSQE/Wood et al. - 2018 - Using metapopulation models to assess species cons.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One factor responsible for this drastic change in prairie-dog population structure is plague (caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis). We ﬁt stochastic patch occupancy models to 20 years of prairie-dog colony occupancy data from two discrete metapopulations (west and east) in the Pawnee National Grassland in Colorado, USA, that differ in connectivity among suitable habitat patches. We conducted model selection between two hypothesized modes of plague movement: independent of prairie-dog dispersal (colony-area) vs. plague movement consistent with prairie-dog dispersal (connectivity to extinct colonies). The best model, which ﬁt the data well (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.94 west area; 0.79 east area), revealed that over time the proportion of extant colonies was better explained by colony size than by connectivity to extinct (plagued) colonies. The idea that prairie dogs are not likely to be the main vector that spreads Y. pestis across the landscape is supported by the observation that colony extinctions are primarily caused by plague, prairie-dog dispersal is short range, and connectivity to extinct colonies was not selected as a factor in the models. We also conducted simulations with the best model to examine long-term patterns of colony occupancy and persistence of prairie-dog metapopulations. In the case where the metapopulations persist, our model predicted that the western metapopulation would have a colony occupancy rate approximately 2.5 times higher than that of the eastern metapopulation (;50% occupied colonies vs. 20%) in 50 years, but that the western metapopulation has ;80% chance of extinction in 100 years while the eastern metapopulation has a less than 25% chance. Extinction probability of individual colonies depended on the frequency with which colonies of the same size class occurred in the metapopulation. Thus, the long-term persistence of prairie-dog metapopulations depended on speciﬁc details of the metapopulation.","2013-07","2021-10-27 04:42:05","2021-10-27 04:42:05","2021-10-27 04:42:05","1572-1583","","7","94","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/3ZV55UJW/George et al. - 2013 - Persistence of black-tailed prairie-dog population.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a framework for using abundance-based estimates of detectability in the analysis of a spatially-explicit stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM). We illustrate our approach with the example of Tenebrio opacus, a beetle inhabiting hollows in old trees, and have based it on a 6-year monitoring programme of adult beetles in an area harbouring a high density of old oaks. We validated our abundance-based methodology by showing that the estimates of detectability were positively and significantly correlated with those obtained from presence/absence data (Pearson r = 0.54, p < 2E−16) in our study system. We further showed that the height of the hollow on the tree and the area of its entrance hole, the living status and girth of the host tree, and the time of survey significantly affected the detectability of beetle populations. Median detectability was 51% for one survey. The SPOM analysis revealed a high but heterogeneous extinction risk among trees, suggesting a metapopulation dynamics between the “classic” and “mainland–island” paradigms. However, it also indicated unexplained beetle colonization of trees in our study, despite the fact that we included limited detectability in our estimation procedure. This may have been due to the cryptic larval stage of T. opacus and may thus invalidate the use of a classic SPOM in our study system.","2018-11","2021-10-27 04:42:14","2021-10-27 04:42:14","2021-10-27 04:42:14","671-682","","3","188","","Oecologia","Abundance-based detectability in a spatially-explicit metapopulation","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/VQA2CVVZ/Laroche et al. - 2018 - Abundance-based detectability in a spatially-expli.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Disturbances are expected to reduce metapopulation occupancy for species associated with stable habitats, but they may benefit species adapted to transitory habitats by maintaining a dynamic mosaic of successional stages. However, while early-successional species may be favoured by very frequent disturbances resetting successional dynamics, metapopulation occupancy may be highest at intermediate disturbance levels for species with mid-successional habitat preferences, though this may be conditional on species traits and patch network characteristics. Here we test this ‘intermediate disturbance hypothesis’ applied to metapopulations (MIDH), using stochastic patch occupancy simulation modelling to assess when does intermediate disturbance favour metapopulation occupancy. We focused on 54 virtual species varying in their habitat preferences, dispersal abilities and local extinction and colonization rates. Long-term metapopulation dynamics was estimated in landscapes with different habitat amounts and patch turnover rates (i.e. disturbance frequency). Results:  Equilibrium metapopulation occupancy by late-successional species strongly declined with increasing disturbance frequency, while occupancy by early-successional species increased with disturbance frequency at low disturbance levels and tended to level-off thereafter. Occupancy by mid-successional species tended to increase along with disturbance frequency at low disturbance levels and declining thereafter. Irrespective of habitat preferences, occupancy increased with the amount of habitat, and with species dispersal ability and colonisation efficiency. Conclusions:  Our study suggests that MIDH is verified only for species associated with mid-successional habitats. These species may be particularly sensitive to land use changes causing either increases or decreases in disturbance frequency. This may be the case, for instance, of species associated with traditional agricultural and pastoral mosaic landscapes, where many species disappear either through intensification or abandonment processes that change disturbance frequency.","2020-12","2021-10-27 04:42:16","2021-10-27 04:42:16","2021-10-27 04:42:16","2","","1","20","","BMC Ecol","Species traits, patch turnover and successional dynamics","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/THRMXMYU/Mestre et al. - 2020 - Species traits, patch turnover and successional dy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We model the local patch emergence rate as the function of site suitability to patch emergence –a permanent factor–and local disturbance intensity, which we first estimate from empirical data and then simulate using annually updating spatial random fields. Using this model, we test whether and how a mobile disturbance pattern affects metapopulation persistence of the false heath fritillary butterfly (Melitaea diamina). Results: In our case study, a mobile disturbance pattern caused new patches to emerge further away from occupied patches over time. This decreased the probability of new patches becoming colonized and thus impaired metapopulation persistence even when the median distance between patches appeared unchanging. However, if disturbances moved to areas that were highly suitable to patch emergence, increased habitat availability could compensate the otherwise detrimental effects of a mobile disturbance pattern. Disturbances that had a moderate degree of mobility had the most uncertain effects to metapopulation persistence. Conclusions: Our modelling approach distinguishes between two processes behind the spatio-temporal pattern and rates of patch emergence–disturbance dynamics and varying site suitability. It enables the use of social and environmental data for forecasting habitat availability for early-succession habitat specialists under alternative future scenarios. It can be applied and developed further to suit multiple study systems. Our case study suggests that for species conservation, it is either beneficial to organize recurring management activities to take place at constant locations, or to gradually shift them towards areas that are highly suitable to patch emergence.","2021-11","2021-10-27 04:45:17","2021-10-27 04:45:17","2021-10-27 04:45:17","109738","","","460","","Ecological Modelling","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/KSLZ8PPR/Fabritius et al. - 2021 - Effects of a mobile disturbance pattern on dynamic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a spatially implicit stochastic metapopulation model and stochastic dynamic programming (SDP), we found the optimal solution to this problem for both the ﬁnite- and inﬁnite-time horizon cases. We showed that the SDP solutions outperform a range of heuristic management strategies. The optimal strategy for a given parameter set depends heavily on metapopulation parameters, and it is difﬁcult to make generalizations about the optimal restoration strategy a priori. Although heuristic strategies perform well in some cases, it is not possible to judge their performance until the SDP solution has been computed, and for this reason we advocate the use of SDP as a management tool in restoration. We demonstrate the use of SDP by deriving an optimal management strategy for a population of the Mount Lofty Ranges Southern Emu-wren (Stipiturus malachurus intermedius).","2010-03","2021-10-27 04:45:22","2021-10-27 04:45:22","2021-10-27 04:45:22","566-581","","2","20","","Ecological Applications","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/I6NKY6TH/Nicol and Possingham - 2010 - Should metapopulation restoration strategies incre.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shifting will be faster as the proportion of suitable habitat in the landscape increases. However, it is not known how the spatial arrangement of habitat will affect the speed of range advance, especially when habitat is scarce, as is the case for many specialist species. We develop methods for calculating the speed of advance that are appropriate for highly fragmented, stochastic systems. We reveal that spatial aggregation of habitat tends to reduce the speed of advance throughout a wide range of species parameters: different dispersal distances and dispersal kernel shapes, and high and low extinction probabilities. In contrast, aggregation increases the steady-state proportion of habitat that is occupied (without climate change). Nonetheless, we find that it is possible to achieve both rapid advance and relatively high patch occupancy when the habitat has a ‘‘channeled’’ pattern, resembling corridors or chains of stepping stones. We adapt techniques from electrical circuit theory to predict the rate of advance efficiently for complex, realistic landscape patterns, whereas the rate cannot be predicted by any simple statistic of aggregation or fragmentation. Conservationists are already advocating corridors and stepping stones as important conservation tools under climate change, but they are vaguely defined and have so far lacked a convincing basis in fundamental population biology. Our work shows how to discriminate properties of a landscape’s spatial pattern that affect the speed of colonization (including, but not limited to, patterns like corridors and chains of stepping stones), and properties that affect a species’ probability of persistence once established. We can therefore point the way to better land use planning approaches, which will provide functional habitat linkages and also maintain local population viability.","2012-10-17","2021-10-27 04:45:31","2021-10-27 04:45:31","2021-10-27 04:45:31","e47141","","10","7","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/CHGDHKZ7/Hodgson et al. - 2012 - The Speed of Range Shifts in Fragmented Landscapes.pdf","","","","Getz, Wayne M.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the contributions of stage structure, spatially correlated processes, and the rescue effect to metapopulation dynamics have been investigated in isolation, there is no empirical demonstration of all of these processes shaping dynamics in a single system. Dispersal and settlement differ according to the life stage involved; therefore, stage-speciﬁc population size may outperform total population size when predicting colonization–extinction dynamics. Synchrony in patch dynamics can lead to accelerated metapopulation extinction, although empirical evidence of the interplay between correlated colonization events and correlated extinctions is lacking. Likewise, few empirical examples exist that provide compelling evidence of migration acting to reduce extinction risk (the rescue effect). We parameterized a hierarchy of metapopulation models to investigate these predictions using a seven-year study of a naturally occurring water vole (Arvicola amphibius) metapopulation. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrated the importance of local stage structure in predicting both colonization and extinction events using juvenile and adult population sizes, respectively. Using a novel approach for quantifying correlation in extinction events, we compared the scale of synchrony in colonization and extinction. Strikingly, the scale of dispersal acting to synchronize colonization was an order of magnitude larger than that of correlated extinctions (halving distance of the effect: 12.40 km and 0.89 km, respectively). Additionally, we found compelling evidence for the existence of a nontrivial rescue effect. Here we provide a novel empirical demonstration of a variety of metapopulation processes operating at multiple spatial scales, further emphasizing the need to consider stage structure and local synchrony in the dynamics of spatially dependent, stage-structured (meta) populations.","2012-11","2021-10-27 04:45:33","2021-10-27 04:45:33","2021-10-27 04:45:33","2465-2473","","11","93","","Ecology","Multi-scale processes in metapopulations","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/K335H3FG/Sutherland et al. - 2012 - Multi-scale processes in metapopulations contribu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet management budgets are universally tight. When planning such actions, managers face the fundamental and complex problem of choosing where and when to invest limited resources to maximize the likelihood of species persistence. Here, we extend our previous research on this problem, and demonstrate the utility of coupling occupancy models with optimization algorithms to identify preferred habitat management schemes across multiple, disjunct habitat networks. Our realworld case study, completed in close collaboration with conservation managers, focussed on optimal habitat creation schemes for a threatened Australian frog in a rapidly urbanizing region. Our new technique identiﬁed clear priorities for investment in wetland construction both among and within seven disjunct habitat networks, solving a spatial prioritization problem that entailed millions of potential solutions and which was otherwise intractable. Such complex, multi-scale spatial prioritization problems are pervasive in amphibian conservation. Coupling occupancy models with spatial optimization algorithms represents a promising avenue to solve these problems and design habitat protection, creation and management schemes that maximize the chance of species persistence.","2019-08","2021-10-27 04:49:06","2021-10-27 04:49:06","2021-10-27 04:49:06","60-69","","","236","","Biological Conservation","Optimizing habitat management for amphibians","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/8C2G9QBY/Scroggie et al. - 2019 - Optimizing habitat management for amphibians From.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use metapopulations of the marsh fritillary butterﬂy Euphydryas aurinia in the United Kingdom as a model system to test for extinction debt in a declining species. We derive parameters for a metapopulation model (incidence function model, IFM) using information from a 625-km2 landscape where habitat patch occupancy, colonization, and extinction rates for E. aurinia depend on patch connectivity, area, and quality. We then show that habitat networks in six extant metapopulations in 16km2 squares were larger, had longer modeled persistence times (using IFM), and higher metapopulation capacity (kM) than six extinct metapopulations. However, there was a .99% chance that one or more of the six extant metapopulations would go extinct in 100 years in the absence of further habitat loss. For 11 out of 12 networks, minimum areas of habitat needed for 95% persistence of metapopulation simulations after 100 years ranged from 80 to 142 ha (;5–9% of land area), depending on the spatial location of habitat. The area of habitat exceeded the estimated minimum viable metapopulation size (MVM) in only two of the six extant metapopulations, and even then by only 20%. The remaining four extant networks were expected to suffer extinction in 15–126 years. MVM was consistently estimated as ;5% of land area based on a sensitivity analysis of IFM parameters and was reduced only marginally (to ;4%) by modeling the potential impact of long-distance colonization over wider landscapes. The results suggest a widespread extinction debt among extant metapopulations of a declining species, necessitating conservation management or reserve designation even in apparent strongholds. For threatened species, metapopulation modeling is a potential means to identify landscapes near to extinction thresholds, to which conservation measures can be targeted for the best chance of success.","2007-07","2021-10-27 04:49:18","2021-10-27 04:49:18","2021-10-27 04:49:18","1460-1473","","5","17","","Ecological Applications","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/SKZQIRMW/Bulman et al. - 2007 - MINIMUM VIABLE METAPOPULATION SIZE, EXTINCTION DEB.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In real landscapes, timing and duration of disturbances can vary, and species’ responses to habitat changes will depend on how timing of dispersal and reproduction events relate to the landscape temporal structure. For instance, increasing disturbance frequency may promote extinction of species that are unable to appropriately time their reproduction in an ever-changing habitat and favor species that are able to track habitat changes. We developed a mathematical model to compare the effects of pulsed dispersal, initiated by shifts in habitat quality, with temporally continuous dispersal. We tested the effects of habitat (and population) turnover rates on metapopulation establishment, persistence, and long-term patch occupancy. Pulsed dispersal reduced patch occupancy and metapopulation longevity when habitat patches are relatively permanent. In such cases, demographic extinction was the primary form of local extinction. Conversely, when habitat patches are short-lived and new ones are frequently formed, pulsed dispersal promoted rapid colonization, increased occupancy, and prolonged metapopulation persistence. Our results show that species responsiveness to habitat disturbance is critical to metapopulation persistence, having profound implications for the species likely to persist in landscapes with altered disturbance regimes.","2015-02","2021-10-27 04:49:21","2021-10-27 04:49:21","2021-10-27 04:49:21","183-195","","2","185","","The American Naturalist","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/WQRQ9VXP/Reigada et al. - 2015 - Metapopulation Dynamics on Ephemeral Patches.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used the world’s smallest butterfly, the Sinai baton blue (Pseudophilotes sinaicus), as an exemplar of how global warming and human population pressures may act together to cause species extinctions. We mapped the entire global range of this butterfly and obtained extensive data on the intensity of livestock grazing. As with an increasing number of species, it is confined to a network of small habitat patches and is threatened both by indirect human-induced factors (global warming) and by the direct activities of humans (in this case, livestock grazing and collection of medicinal plants). In the absence of global warming, grazing, and plant collection, our model suggested that the butterfly will persist for at least 200 years. Above a threshold intensity of global warming, the chance of extinction accelerated rapidly, implying that there may be an annual average temperature, specific to each endangered species, above which extinction becomes very much more likely. By contrast, there was no such threshold of grazing pressure—the chance of extinction increased steadily with increasing grazing. The impact of grazing, however, decreased with higher levels of year-to-year variation in habitat quality. The effect of global warming did not depend on the future level of grazing, suggesting that the impacts of global warming and grazing are additive. If the areas of habitat patches individually fall below certain prescribed levels, the butterfly is likely to go extinct. Two patches were very important for persistence: if either were lost the species would probably go extinct. Our results have implications for the conservation management of all species whose habitats are at risk because of the direct activities of humans and in the longer term because of climate change.","2005-08","2021-10-27 04:49:26","2021-10-27 04:49:26","2021-10-27 04:49:26","1113-1124","","4","19","","Conservation Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/HCJKKEZR/Hoyle and James - 2005 - Global Warming, Human Population Pressure, and Via.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a metapopulation model study it has recently been found that reducing the extinction probability of the least extinction-prone patch and increasing the colonization probability between the two least extinction-prone patches are the best options to prolong the expected lifetime of a metapopulation. In this article I examine with a more detailed model whether this translates into enlarging the largest patch and reducing the interpatch distance between the largest patches. Using two measures of metapopulation persistence (longevity and resilience) I found, ﬁrstly, that the largest patch should generally be enlarged if the choice is to enlarge a patch by a certain percentage (relative change) and that the smallest patch should generally be enlarged if the choice is to enlarge a patch by a ﬁxed amount of area (absolute change), and secondly that indeed one should reduce the interpatch distance between the two largest patches, if the choice is among all pairs of patches. The strength of these rules of thumb (particularly the second part of the ﬁrst rule) depends on the parameter values, particularly the amount of clustering of patches, the mean dispersal distance and the number of dispersers. Also, the rules of thumb are less pronounced when resilience is chosen as a measure of metapopulation persistence than when longevity is chosen.","2004-11","2021-10-27 04:52:07","2021-10-27 04:52:08","2021-10-27 04:52:07","77-90","","1","179","","Ecological Modelling","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/NGUQNVBC/Etienne - 2004 - On optimal choices in increase of patch area and r.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This leads to high uncertainty in parameter values and model outputs and complicates the formulation of clear recommendations for conservation management. We present a comprehensive procedure that is able to process spatiotemporal patterns of metapopulation occupancy to rank management scenarios. The ﬁrst step of the procedure involves the formulation of the stochastic metapopulation model and the estimation of parameter values with a Bayesian approach, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In the second step, the model is used to predict the effects of different management actions, taking into account the uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Finally, in the third step, decision analysis is used to evaluate and aggregate the results of the previous step into a simple rank order of management scenarios. The procedure was applied to a metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary, Melitaea cinxia. Although the amount of available occupancy data was considerable, the uncertainty in the estimated model parameter values was so large that a precise estimate of the extinction risk of the metapopulation could not be made. However, the procedure was able to produce a rank order of management scenarios that was extraordinarily robust to the uncertainty. Application of the procedure to two other case studies revealed that, even though robust rankings cannot always be obtained, the results of the procedure are helpful in assessing the degree of uncertainty in the ranking and pointing to those factors most responsible for the lack of robustness. The results of this paper demonstrate very clearly, by way of example, both the limitations and the possibilities of model-based metapopulation viability analysis.","2003-08","2021-10-27 04:52:12","2021-10-27 04:52:12","2021-10-27 04:52:12","990-998","","4","13","","Ecological Applications","RANKING METAPOPULATION EXTINCTION RISK","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/PJIBGSVJ/Drechsler et al. - 2003 - RANKING METAPOPULATION EXTINCTION RISK FROM PATTE.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dispersal in the model is directed toward local (nearby) suitable habitat patches, following the observed seed-caching behavior of the European Jay. Model parameters were estimated using Bayesian methods and survey data from 12 047 plots. Model simulations were conducted to explore the importance of different dispersal modes (local directed, global directed, local random, global random). The SPOM with local directed dispersal gave a much better ﬁt to the data and reproduced observed regional abundance, abundance–environment correlations, and spatial autocorrelation in abundance for all three species.

While hundreds of offsetting schemes are used around the globe, the optimal timing of habitat creation in such projects is poorly understood. Here, we developed a spatially explicit metapopulation model for a single species subject to a habitat compensation scheme. Managers could compensate for destruction of a patch by creating a new patch either before, at the time of, or after patch loss. Delaying patch creation is intuitively detrimental to species persistence, but allowed managers to invest financial compensation, accrue interest, and create a larger patch at a later date. Using stochastic dynamic programming, we found the optimal timing of patch creation that maximizes the number of patches occupied at the end of a 50-yr habitat compensation scheme when a patch is destroyed after 10 yr. Two case studies were developed for Australian species subject to habitat loss but with very different traits: the endangered growling grass frog (Litoria raniformis) and the critically endangered Mount Lofty Ranges Southern Emu-wren (Spititurus malachurus intermedius). Our results show that adding a patch either before or well after habitat destruction can be optimal, depending on the occupancy state of the metapopulation, the interest rate, the area of the destroyed patch and metapopulation parameters of the focal species. Generally, it was better to delay patch creation when the interest rate was high, when the species had a relatively high colonization rate, when the patch nearest the new patch was occupied, and when the destroyed patch was small. Our framework can be applied to single-species metapopulations subject to habitat loss, and demonstrates that considering the timing of habitat compensation could improve the effectiveness of offsetting schemes.","2018-03","2021-10-27 04:52:25","2021-10-27 04:52:25","2021-10-27 04:52:25","508-521","","2","28","","Ecol Appl","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/9232W2T2/Southwell et al. - 2018 - Optimal timing of biodiversity offsetting for meta.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The question studied here is the following: Which subset of sites do you select to maximize the long-term persistence of a species living in a metapopulation, given that each site has a cost and the amount of resource (e.g., money) available is limited? We present an optimization method, which uses a combination of evolutionary optimization (a genetic algorithm) and local search to ﬁnd the optimal selection of sites. The quality of each candidate solution is evaluated using a spatially realistic metapopulation model, the incidence function model. The proposed method is applied to a metapopulation of the false heath fritillary butterﬂy, an endangered species in Finland. With this data set, the proposed estimation method produces intuitively acceptable and consistent results within minutes of computation time.

A further major criticism of current ecological impact assessments is that they tend to be qualitative. Here we develop methods that apply the Incidence Function Model (IFM) in real urban planning contexts, by generating repeatable and comparable quantitative measures of ecological impacts. To demonstrate the methods for a case study (Nottingham, UK), we estimated landscape-scale measures of species' persistence that indicate metapopulation viability. We based these on Nottingham’s landscape when urban developments were recently proposed, then adjust the land cover to include the proposed developments, and also for two projected landscapes where 10% and 20% of the original natural or semi-natural land cover is lost. We ﬁnd that the IFM shows promise as a tool for quantitative landscape-scale ecological impact assessment, depending on the size of the impact. We detected minimal diﬀerences in the species' viability measures between the original and post-development landscapes. This suggests that for small (around 2%) cumulative losses of natural/semi-natural space, current site-based approaches are suﬃcient. However, when the cumulative eﬀect of continued development was modelled by increasing the losses of natural/semi-natural land cover to 10–20% of existing cover, the impact on many of the species studied was more substantial. This indicates that a landscapescale approach is necessary for larger, prolonged and cumulative habitat losses.","2018-02","2021-10-27 04:58:35","2021-10-27 04:58:35","2021-10-27 04:58:35","187-194","","","170","","Landscape and Urban Planning","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/BFNPFYCN/Graham et al. - 2018 - The incidence function model as a tool for landsca.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate that the most appropriate measure of fragment value depends on the question asked. Speciﬁcally, we analyse four alternative measures: the contribution of a fragment to the metapopulation capacity of the network, to the equilibrium metapopulation size, to the expected time to metapopulation extinction and the long-term contribution of a fragment to colonization events in the network. The latter measure is comparable to densitydependent measures in general matrix population theory, though some differences are introduced by the fact that ‘‘density dependence’’ is spatially localized in the metapopulation context. We show that the value of a fragment depends not only on the properties of the landscape but also on the properties of the species. Most importantly, variation in fragment values between the habitat fragments is greatest in the case of rare species that occur close to the extinction threshold, as these species are likely to be restricted to the most favorable parts of the landscape. We expect that the measures of habitat fragment value described and analysed here have applications in landscape ecology and in conservation biology.","2003-12","2021-10-27 04:58:38","2021-10-27 04:58:38","2021-10-27 04:58:38","481-495","","4","64","","Theoretical Population Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/FC3HINPN/Ovaskainen and Hanski - 2003 - How much does an individual habitat fragment contr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, for natural populations symmetry is often broken, e.g. for species in the marine environment dispersing through the transport of pelagic larvae with ocean currents. The few recent studies of asymmetric dispersal concluded, that asymmetry has a distinct negative impact on the persistence of metapopulations. Detailed analysis however revealed, that these previous studies might have been unable to properly disentangle the eﬀect of symmetry from other potentially confounding properties of dispersal patterns. We resolve this issue by systematically investigating the symmetry of dispersal patterns and its impact on metapopulation persistence. Our main analysis based on a metapopulation model equivalent to previous studies but now applied on regular dispersal patterns aims to isolate the eﬀect of dispersal symmetry on metapopulation persistence. Our results suggest, that asymmetry in itself does not imply negative eﬀects on metapopulation persistence. For this reason we recommend to investigate it in connection with other properties of dispersal instead of in isolation.","2011-12","2021-10-27 04:58:43","2021-10-27 04:58:43","2021-10-27 04:58:43","37-45","","","290","","Journal of Theoretical Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1011.1109","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/AUZAB6GP/Kleinhans and Jonsson - 2011 - On the impact of dispersal asymmetry on metapopula.pdf","","","Quantitative Biology - Populations and Evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined the spatial dynamics of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that spawn in 36 streams of the Stuart River watershed in British Columbia, Canada, using a 69-year record of spawner abundance and a demographically based Bayesian dynamic occupancy model. We identiﬁed a set of 12 streams with good habitat conditions that were occupied >90% of years despite large year-to-year changes in abundance. Over 85% of spawners were concentrated in these streams. Many other streams with poorer habitat had small populations that were not persistent over time and were periodically recolonized by dispersers from other streams. Although it is often assumed population diversity and resiliency is maximized when all available habitats are used, for this salmon metapopulation, resiliency is due to the core streams of higher habitat quality. Currently, other streams make only small contributions to population abundance; however, some may have conservation value if their habitats become more suitable for spawning in the future.","2021-08","2021-10-27 04:58:45","2021-10-27 04:58:45","2021-10-27 04:58:45","1084-1095","","8","78","","Can.

Here, we employ spatially explicit simulations of large numbers of species in spatially heterogeneous landscapes to investigate SARs and extinctions in a dynamic context. The EAR gives the number of species going extinct immediately after habitat loss, but typically many other species have unviable populations in the remaining habitat and go extinct soon afterwards. We conclude that the EAR underestimates extinctions due to habitat loss, the continental SAR (with slope ~0.1 or somewhat less) gives a good approximation of short-term extinctions, while the island SAR calculated for discrete fragments of habitat (with slope ~0.25) predicts the long-term extinctions. However, when the remaining area of land-covering habitat such as forest is roughly less than 20% of the total landscape and the habitat is highly fragmented, all current SARs underestimate extinction rate. We show how the ‘fragmentation effect’ can be incorporated into a predictive SAR model. When the remaining habitat is highly fragmented, an effective way to combat the fragmentation effect is to aggregate habitat fragments into clusters rather than to place them randomly across the landscape.","2013-05","2021-10-27 04:58:49","2021-10-27 04:58:49","2021-10-27 04:58:49","27-38","","","16","","Ecol Lett","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/CK66JXFQ/Rybicki and Hanski - 2013 - Species-area relationships and extinctions caused .pdf","","","","Enquist, Brian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This effect has been frequently used to describe geographic richness gradients of trophically similar species, but how it scales across different trophic levels is poorly understood. Here, we study the role of geometric constraints for the formation of spatial gradients in trophically structured metacommunities. We model colonization–extinction dynamics of a simple food chain on a network of habitat patches embedded in a one- or two-dimensional domain. In a spatially homogeneous or well-mixed system, we find that the food chain length increases with the square root of the ratio of colonization and extinction rates. In a spatially bounded domain, we find that the patch occupancy decreases towards the edge of the domain for all species of the food web, but this spatial gradient varies with the trophic level. As a consequence, the average food chain length peaks in the center and declines towards the boundaries of the domain, thereby extending the notion of a mid-domain effect from species richness to food chain length. This trophic mid-domain effect already arises in a one-dimensional domain, but it is most pronounced at the headlands in a two-dimensional domain. As the mid-domain effect for food chain length is caused solely by spatial boundaries and requires no other environmental heterogeneity, it can be considered a null expectation for geographic patterns in spatially extended food webs.","2020-09","2021-10-27 04:58:54","2021-10-27 04:58:54","2021-10-27 04:58:54","301-315","","3","13","","Theor Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kelleherj/Zotero/storage/YJAZS22C/Prillwitz and Blasius - 2020 - Mid-domain effect for food chain length in a colon.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
